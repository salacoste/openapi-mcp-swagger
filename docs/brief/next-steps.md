# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Validate Technical Assumptions:** Test stream-based JSON parsing performance with your existing 262KB Ozon API file and 2-3 additional large Swagger files to confirm scalability approach

2. **Research MCP Integration Landscape:** Survey current AI development tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, etc.) for existing or planned MCP support to validate protocol adoption assumption

3. **Competitive Analysis Deep Dive:** Analyze existing API documentation tools (Postman, Insomnia, Swagger Hub) and their AI integration strategies to identify differentiation opportunities

4. **Technical Prototype Planning:** Design minimal proof-of-concept architecture focusing on parser → storage → MCP server pipeline to validate core technical approach

5. **User Research Initiation:** Interview 5-10 enterprise developers about current API documentation workflows with AI assistants to validate problem severity and solution approach

## PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for **Universal Swagger → MCP Server Converter**. Please start in 'PRD Generation Mode', review the brief thoroughly to work with the user to create the PRD section by section as the template indicates, asking for any necessary clarification or suggesting improvements.

**Key areas for PRD focus:**
- Functional requirements for the three core MCP methods (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample)
- Non-functional requirements for parsing performance and concurrent query handling
- User stories for primary segment (AI-enhanced developers) across typical API integration workflows
- Technical architecture decisions and implementation approach validation
- Success metrics and validation criteria for MVP launch

The project is well-positioned with clear market need, focused technical approach, and realistic scope - ready for detailed product requirements development.
