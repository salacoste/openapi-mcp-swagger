# Technical Considerations

## Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Cross-platform deployment (macOS, Linux, Windows) with containerized deployment options
- **Runtime Support:** Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+ environments with standard system dependencies
- **Performance Requirements:** Sub-200ms query response, <500ms schema retrieval, handle 10MB+ Swagger files within 2GB RAM footprint

## Technology Preferences
- **Language Choice:** Python recommended for rich OpenAPI ecosystem (openapi-spec-validator, jsonref) and mature MCP implementations
- **Parser Framework:** Stream-based JSON processing using ijson or similar for memory-efficient large file handling
- **Database:** SQLite for MVP (simple deployment), DuckDB evaluation for analytical query performance on large schemas
- **Search Engine:** Whoosh or similar pure-Python solution for BM25 indexing, avoiding external dependencies
- **MCP Framework:** Leverage existing Python MCP SDK for protocol compliance and future compatibility

## Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with clear separation: `/parser` (OpenAPI processing), `/storage` (database layer), `/server` (MCP implementation), `/cli` (user interface)
- **Service Architecture:** Single-process architecture for MVP, designed for future microservice decomposition (parser service, search service, MCP gateway)
- **Integration Requirements:** Standard MCP protocol compliance for seamless AI assistant integration, with extensible plugin architecture for custom processing
- **Security/Compliance:** Local-first deployment model (no cloud dependencies), optional API key protection for MCP endpoints, audit logging for enterprise compliance
