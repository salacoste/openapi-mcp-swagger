# Post-MVP Vision

## Phase 2 Features

**Advanced Search & Discovery:**
- Vector-based semantic search for endpoint similarity matching ("find endpoints like this one")
- AI-powered API workflow discovery that suggests logical endpoint sequences for common tasks
- Smart parameter validation with real-time feedback on request structure

**Enhanced Code Generation:**
- Custom template engine supporting additional languages (Go, Rust, C#, PHP)
- Framework-specific examples (React hooks, Vue composables, Angular services)
- Error handling patterns and retry logic generation

**Developer Experience:**
- VS Code extension with inline API documentation and MCP integration
- Interactive API testing directly within AI chat interfaces
- Automatic change detection and incremental updates for evolving APIs

## Long-term Vision

**Ecosystem Platform (1-2 Years):**
Transform from single-API processing tool into comprehensive API ecosystem intelligence platform. Enable organizations to create unified, AI-accessible views of their entire API landscape - internal, partner, and third-party APIs - with intelligent relationship mapping, dependency analysis, and automated integration guidance.

**AI-Native API Development:**
Pioneer the next generation of API-first development where AI agents can not only consume but also suggest API designs, identify integration opportunities, and automatically generate integration code across entire service architectures.

## Expansion Opportunities

**Protocol Extensions:**
- GraphQL schema processing and MCP serving for modern API ecosystems
- gRPC service definition support for microservice architectures
- AsyncAPI support for event-driven and streaming API patterns

**Enterprise Platform:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS deployment with organizational API catalog management
- Integration marketplace for pre-built API connectors and workflow templates
- Advanced analytics on API usage patterns and integration success rates

**AI Toolchain Integration:**
- Native integrations with emerging AI development platforms and workflow engines
- Plugin ecosystem for custom processing and serving extensions
- Real-time collaboration features for AI-assisted team development
