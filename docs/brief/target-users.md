# Target Users

## Primary User Segment: AI-Enhanced Developers

**Demographic/Firmographic Profile:**
- Software engineers working with APIs (3+ years experience)
- Teams using AI coding assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- Enterprise developers at companies with complex API ecosystems
- Technical leads responsible for API integration workflows

**Current Behaviors and Workflows:**
- Rely on AI assistants for code generation and API integration tasks
- Manually copy-paste API documentation into AI chats when files are too large
- Fragment large Swagger files or skip comprehensive documentation review
- Switch between AI tools and traditional API documentation frequently
- Spend significant time translating API docs into working code examples

**Specific Needs and Pain Points:**
- Need comprehensive API understanding without context window limitations
- Want AI assistants to work with complete enterprise API documentation
- Require consistent access to up-to-date API schemas and examples
- Need seamless integration between documentation and development workflow
- Want automated code example generation in their preferred languages/formats

**Goals They're Trying to Achieve:**
- Reduce API integration time from days to hours
- Maintain comprehensive understanding of complex API ecosystems
- Enable AI assistants to provide accurate, context-aware API guidance
- Eliminate manual documentation fragmentation and maintenance

## Secondary User Segment: AI Toolchain Developers

**Demographic/Firmographic Profile:**
- Developers building AI-powered development tools and extensions
- Companies creating AI coding assistants and workflow automation
- Technical teams at organizations with large API catalogs requiring AI accessibility
- DevOps engineers implementing AI-assisted development processes

**Current Behaviors and Workflows:**
- Build custom integrations between AI tools and API documentation
- Create internal tooling to make large APIs accessible to AI assistants
- Develop workarounds for context window limitations in existing tools
- Maintain documentation preprocessing pipelines

**Specific Needs and Pain Points:**
- Need standardized way to make API documentation AI-accessible
- Want reusable solution rather than custom integration for each API
- Require reliable, performant documentation serving infrastructure
- Need protocol-standard interface for consistent AI tool integration

**Goals They're Trying to Achieve:**
- Enable their AI tools to work with any API documentation
- Provide consistent user experience across different API integrations
- Reduce development time for API-aware AI features
- Build scalable solutions for enterprise API environments
