# Risks & Open Questions

## Key Risks

- **MCP Protocol Maturity Risk:** MCP adoption may remain limited to specific AI tools, reducing market reach. If protocol doesn't achieve broad adoption, solution becomes niche tool rather than universal standard.

- **Performance Scalability Risk:** Stream parsing and search performance may degrade significantly with 5MB+ Swagger files or concurrent AI agent queries, limiting enterprise applicability and user satisfaction.

- **OpenAPI Specification Variance Risk:** Real-world API documentation quality varies dramatically - malformed JSON, non-standard extensions, or incomplete schemas could break parsing and reduce reliability.

- **Competitive Response Risk:** Major API documentation platforms (Postman, Insomnia, Swagger Hub) or AI assistant providers could rapidly implement similar functionality, eliminating first-mover advantage.

- **Developer Adoption Risk:** Integration friction or workflow disruption could prevent adoption despite solving real problem - developers may prefer manual approaches over learning new toolchain.

## Open Questions

- What percentage of enterprise APIs actually follow OpenAPI 3.x standards strictly enough for reliable parsing?
- How do AI coding assistants handle MCP protocol timeouts or errors in practice?
- What's the realistic upper limit for Swagger file size processing before user experience degrades significantly?
- Which AI development platforms will prioritize MCP integration versus developing proprietary solutions?
- How sensitive are developers to additional CLI tools and local services in their development environments?

## Areas Needing Further Research

- **Competitive Landscape Analysis:** Comprehensive survey of existing API documentation tools and their AI integration approaches
- **Technical Performance Benchmarking:** Testing stream parsing performance across variety of real-world Swagger files (1KB-10MB range)
- **User Workflow Studies:** Observing how developers currently handle large API documentation with AI assistants
- **MCP Ecosystem Assessment:** Understanding current and planned MCP integrations across AI development tool landscape
- **Enterprise API Documentation Quality Audit:** Analyzing real-world OpenAPI specification compliance and quality patterns
