# Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**
Enterprise API ecosystems generate increasingly complex OpenAPI/Swagger documentation files, with many exceeding 200KB-2MB in size. The sample Ozon Performance API (262KB) represents typical enterprise scale, but developers regularly encounter APIs with 500+ endpoints generating multi-megabyte documentation files.

**Impact & Quantification:**
- **Context Window Barriers:** 90%+ of enterprise APIs exceed standard AI context limits (32K-128K tokens)
- **Development Friction:** Developers spend 3-5 hours manually fragmenting documentation or abandon AI assistance
- **Integration Delays:** API integration projects take 40-60% longer without intelligent documentation access
- **Knowledge Fragmentation:** Teams lose comprehensive API understanding when working with partial documentation

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
Current approaches are fundamentally limited:
- **Manual fragmentation:** Time-intensive, loses context, requires constant maintenance
- **Generic documentation tools:** Not designed for AI agent consumption patterns
- **API-specific solutions:** Work only with particular vendors or size constraints
- **Static documentation:** Cannot provide dynamic querying or intelligent search capabilities

**Urgency & Strategic Importance:**
The convergence of API-first architecture and AI-assisted development creates an immediate market opportunity. As AI coding assistants become standard developer tools, the inability to work with comprehensive API documentation becomes a critical bottleneck limiting the effectiveness of next-generation development workflows.
