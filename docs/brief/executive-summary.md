# Executive Summary

**Universal Swagger â†’ MCP Server Converter** is a specialized development tool that solves a critical bottleneck in AI-driven API integration: the context window limitation when working with large OpenAPI/Swagger documentation files. The system performs intelligent parsing, indexing, and serving of API documentation through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI agents to efficiently query specific endpoints, retrieve schemas, and generate code examples without being constrained by file size.

**Specific Problem Scope:** Many enterprise APIs generate Swagger files exceeding 200KB-2MB+ (like your sample Ozon Performance API at 262KB), which cannot fit within typical AI context windows of 32K-128K tokens. This forces developers to manually fragment documentation or abandon AI assistance entirely.

**Technical Approach:** Stream-based JSON parsing splits large Swagger files while preserving OpenAPI structure, stores normalized data in SQLite/DuckDB with BM25/vector indexing, and exposes three core MCP methods:
- `searchEndpoints(keywords, httpMethods)` - Intelligent endpoint discovery
- `getSchema(componentName)` - Schema definition retrieval
- `getExample(endpoint, format)` - Auto-generated request examples in cURL, JavaScript fetch, Python requests formats

**Market Position:** First universal solution supporting arbitrary-size API documentation with AI-native access patterns, targeting the growing intersection of API-first development and AI-assisted coding workflows.

**Success Metrics:** Enable AI agents to work with 100% of enterprise API documentation regardless of size, reduce API integration time by 60-80% through intelligent documentation access, and establish foundation for next-generation AI-powered development toolchains.
