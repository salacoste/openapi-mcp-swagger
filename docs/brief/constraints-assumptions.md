# Constraints & Assumptions

## Constraints
- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded development requiring minimal external service dependencies and infrastructure costs
- **Timeline:** 3-4 month MVP development window with single developer or small team (2-3 people maximum)
- **Resources:** Limited to open-source technologies and libraries; no enterprise software licensing budget for specialized parsing or search solutions
- **Technical:** Must work with existing OpenAPI 3.x specifications without requiring API modifications; no control over source API documentation quality or completeness

## Key Assumptions
- **MCP Protocol Adoption:** Model Context Protocol will gain broader adoption across AI development tools beyond current implementations
- **Market Demand Validation:** Enterprise developers experience significant productivity friction with large API documentation in AI workflows
- **OpenAPI Standard Compliance:** Target APIs follow OpenAPI 3.x specification standards with reasonable documentation quality
- **AI Assistant Growth:** Continued rapid adoption of AI coding assistants in enterprise development environments
- **Technical Feasibility:** Stream-based parsing can handle enterprise-scale Swagger files (2-10MB) within reasonable performance constraints
- **Integration Simplicity:** Developers will adopt tools that require minimal configuration and integrate seamlessly with existing workflows
- **Local-First Preference:** Enterprise teams prefer locally-deployed solutions over cloud-based API documentation services for security/control reasons
