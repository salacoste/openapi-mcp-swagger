# Story 2.6: MCP Server Performance and Monitoring

## Story Overview
**Epic**: Epic 2 - MCP Server Implementation & Protocol Compliance
**Story ID**: 2.6
**Story Type**: Cross-Functional (Performance & Operations)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Sprint**: TBD

## User Story
As a developer,
I want comprehensive performance monitoring and metrics for the MCP server,
So that I can ensure system reliability and optimize performance under load.

## Story Context

### Business Value
- Ensures MCP server meets performance requirements (NFR1: <200ms search, <500ms schema)
- Provides operational visibility for production deployments and enterprise environments
- Enables proactive performance optimization and capacity planning
- Supports NFR4 requirement: 99.5% uptime through monitoring and health checks

### Dependencies
**Depends On:**
- Story 2.1: MCP Protocol Foundation Setup (MCP server framework operational)
- Story 2.2: searchEndpoints MCP Method Implementation (searchEndpoints performance metrics)
- Story 2.3: getSchema MCP Method Implementation (getSchema performance metrics)
- Story 2.4: getExample MCP Method Implementation (getExample performance metrics)
- Story 2.5: Error Handling and Resilience (error rate monitoring)

**Enables:**
- Complete Epic 2 delivery with production-ready monitoring and observability
- Story 4.3: MCP Server Management and Control (server status and health checks)

### Technical Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All MCP methods, database connections, existing logging framework
- Technology: Python metrics collection, health check endpoints, performance monitoring
- Follows pattern: Existing logging patterns, configuration management from CLI framework
- Touch points: MCP method execution, database query performance, connection management

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Performance Metrics Collection**
   - Collect response time metrics for all MCP methods (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample)
   - Track request volume and throughput (requests per second, concurrent connections)
   - Monitor database query performance and connection pool utilization
   - Measure memory usage and garbage collection impact on response times

2. **Health Check Implementation**
   - Implement `/health` HTTP endpoint for system monitoring and load balancer integration
   - Database connectivity check with connection pool status
   - MCP server responsiveness check with synthetic request testing
   - Overall system health status aggregation (healthy, degraded, unhealthy)

3. **Error Rate and Quality Monitoring**
   - Track error rates by error type and MCP method
   - Monitor validation error patterns to identify common client issues
   - Database connection failure rates and recovery success metrics
   - Circuit breaker activation frequency and recovery time tracking

### Integration Requirements
4. **Logging Framework Integration**
   - Extend existing logging with structured performance metrics
   - Configurable logging levels for production vs. development monitoring
   - Log correlation IDs for request tracing across method calls
   - Integration with external log aggregation systems (JSON format support)

5. **Configuration and Deployment Integration**
   - Performance monitoring configuration through existing CLI config system
   - Environment-specific monitoring settings (development, staging, production)
   - Monitoring endpoint security and access control configuration
   - Integration with existing configuration validation and management

6. **Concurrent Connection Monitoring**
   - Track concurrent AI agent connections per NFR3 (100+ concurrent agents)
   - Connection lifecycle monitoring (connect, active, disconnect patterns)
   - Resource usage per connection for capacity planning
   - Connection pool efficiency and optimal sizing recommendations

### Quality Requirements
7. **Performance Target Validation**
   - Automated validation of NFR1 requirements (<200ms searchEndpoints, <500ms getSchema)
   - Performance regression detection compared to baseline measurements
   - Load testing support for NFR3 concurrent connection requirements
   - Performance alerting when response times exceed thresholds

8. **Monitoring System Performance**
   - Performance monitoring itself adds <5% overhead to request processing
   - Metrics collection doesn't impact normal operation response times
   - Efficient metrics storage and retrieval for historical analysis
   - Monitoring system resilience: continues working during partial system failures

9. **Operational Visibility and Alerting**
   - Real-time performance dashboard for system operators
   - Configurable alerting thresholds for response times and error rates
   - Capacity planning metrics: peak usage, growth trends, resource utilization
   - Performance analytics: slow query identification, optimization opportunities

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Metrics Collection Architecture
```python
import time
from functools import wraps
from typing import Dict, Any
import logging

class PerformanceMetrics:
    """Central metrics collection for MCP server performance"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.request_times: Dict[str, List[float]] = {}
        self.request_counts: Dict[str, int] = {}
        self.error_counts: Dict[str, int] = {}
        self.connection_count: int = 0

    def record_request_time(self, method: str, duration: float):
        """Record request execution time"""
        if method not in self.request_times:
            self.request_times[method] = []
        self.request_times[method].append(duration)

    def get_avg_response_time(self, method: str) -> float:
        """Get average response time for method"""
        times = self.request_times.get(method, [])
        return sum(times) / len(times) if times else 0.0

def monitor_performance(method_name: str):
    """Decorator to monitor MCP method performance"""
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start_time = time.time()
            try:
                result = await func(*args, **kwargs)
                metrics.record_request_time(method_name, time.time() - start_time)
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                metrics.record_error(method_name, str(e))
                raise
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

### Health Check Endpoint Implementation
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

class HealthStatus(BaseModel):
    status: str  # "healthy", "degraded", "unhealthy"
    database: str  # "connected", "degraded", "failed"
    mcp_server: str  # "responsive", "slow", "failed"
    uptime: float  # seconds since startup
    version: str

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check() -> HealthStatus:
    """System health check endpoint"""
    db_status = await check_database_health()
    mcp_status = await check_mcp_responsiveness()

    overall_status = "healthy"
    if db_status != "connected" or mcp_status != "responsive":
        overall_status = "degraded" if db_status != "failed" else "unhealthy"

    return HealthStatus(
        status=overall_status,
        database=db_status,
        mcp_server=mcp_status,
        uptime=time.time() - startup_time,
        version=__version__
    )
```

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk** - Performance monitoring overhead and integration complexity

**Primary Risks:**
- Performance monitoring overhead impacting system performance under load
- Metrics collection causing memory leaks or resource exhaustion
- Health check endpoint becoming single point of failure for monitoring
- Complex performance data causing confusion rather than clarity

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Lightweight metrics collection with efficient data structures
- Configurable monitoring levels to balance detail vs. performance
- Health check endpoint isolation from main MCP server process
- Simple, actionable performance metrics focused on key requirements
- Performance testing of monitoring system itself under load

**Rollback Plan:**
- Disable performance metrics collection if overhead becomes problematic
- Simplify health checks to basic database connectivity only
- Reduce monitoring detail level if system performance affected
- All core MCP functionality remains operational without monitoring

## Story Estimation
**Complexity**: Medium
**Effort**: 3-4 development sessions (12-16 hours)
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Dependencies**: 5 (Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5)
