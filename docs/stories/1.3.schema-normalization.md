2. Preserve schema definitions with full dependency chains and component references
3. Maintain security definition mappings to their respective endpoints

## Dev Notes

### Technology Requirements
- **Pydantic v2**: Data modeling and validation for normalized structures
- **jsonref library**: $ref reference resolution in JSON schemas
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient processing of large API specifications
- **Memory management**: Handle complex schemas within memory constraints
- **Data preservation**: Zero-loss normalization maintaining all original data

### Architecture Integration
Based on approved source tree structure:
- **Location**: `src/swagger_mcp_server/parser/normalization.py`
- **Dependencies**: Receives parsed JSON from stream parser (Story 1.2)
- **Output**: Normalized data structures for storage layer (Story 1.4)
- **Integration**: Works with validation module for consistency checking

### Data Model Design
```python
class NormalizedEndpoint:
    path: str
    method: HttpMethod
    operation_id: Optional[str]
    summary: str
    description: str
    parameters: List[Parameter]
    request_body: Optional[RequestBody]
    responses: Dict[str, Response]
    security: List[SecurityRequirement]
    tags: List[str]
    deprecated: bool = False
    extensions: Dict[str, Any] = {}

class NormalizedSchema:
    name: str
    type: str
    properties: Dict[str, Property]
    required: List[str]
    dependencies: List[str]  # $ref dependencies
    inheritance: Dict[str, Any]  # allOf, oneOf, anyOf
    extensions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
```

### Performance Standards
- **Processing speed**: Handle 1000+ endpoints within 5 seconds
- **Memory efficiency**: Maintain reasonable memory usage for large APIs
- **Reference resolution**: Resolve complex $ref chains efficiently
- **Search optimization**: Create indexes suitable for sub-200ms search
- **Data integrity**: 100% preservation of original OpenAPI data

### Search Optimization Features
- **Full-text indexing**: Extract all searchable text for BM25 ranking
- **Keyword extraction**: Identify important terms from descriptions
- **Parameter indexing**: Create searchable parameter names and types
- **Tag normalization**: Standardize and index endpoint tags
- **Relationship mapping**: Build efficient endpoint-to-schema graphs
- **Search hints**: Add metadata to optimize search queries

### Testing Standards
- **Unit tests**: `src/tests/unit/test_parser/test_normalization.py`
- **Complex schema tests**: Test with real-world complex APIs
- **Reference resolution tests**: Validate $ref handling with edge cases
- **Performance benchmarks**: Validate processing time requirements
- **Data integrity tests**: Ensure no data loss during normalization
- **Extension tests**: Verify all vendor extensions are preserved

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Reference errors**: Handle broken $ref links gracefully
- **Schema inconsistencies**: Report validation errors with context
- **Missing components**: Identify and report missing schema references
- **Circular references**: Handle infinite loops in reference chains
- **Invalid data**: Process malformed sections with error reporting
- **Recovery mechanisms**: Continue processing valid sections when possible
