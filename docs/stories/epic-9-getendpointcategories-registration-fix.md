# Epic 9: getEndpointCategories MCP Tool Registration Fix - Brownfield Enhancement

## ‚úÖ EPIC STATUS: CLOSED - INVALID PREMISE ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ **CLOSED - Feature Already Implemented** (Investigation Complete: 2025-10-01)
**Quality Score:** **N/A** (Epic premise was incorrect - no work needed)
**Resolution:** Redirect to Epic 8 (Database Population)
**Investigation:** Story 9.1 Complete - See `docs/qa/epic-9-investigation-report.md`
**Closure Date:** 2025-10-01
**Closed By:** Product Owner (based on investigation findings)

### Investigation Findings ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ Tool **IS** registered (mcp_server_v2.py:267-291 using native MCP SDK)
- ‚úÖ Method handler **EXISTS** (lines 344-347)
- ‚úÖ Full implementation **COMPLETE** (lines 1569+)
- ‚ùå Database table **EMPTY** (0 records in endpoint_categories)
- ‚úÖ Root cause: **Epic 8 dependency** (database population not registration)

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS (SM Bob - Technical Review)

**Epic Premise:** getEndpointCategories is not registered as an MCP tool and needs @mcp.tool() decorator

**Actual Reality:**
1. ‚úÖ **Tool IS ALREADY REGISTERED** (mcp_server_v2.py:267-297 using native MCP SDK)
2. ‚ùå **FastMCP Framework NOT USED** (@mcp.tool() decorator approach doesn't exist)
3. ‚úÖ **Method handler IMPLEMENTED** (lines 344-347, 1569-1604)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Real problem UNKNOWN** (requires investigation - likely database, config, or deployment issue)

**Developer Warning:** ‚ùå **DO NOT IMPLEMENT Stories 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3 as currently written**

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete investigation checklist (see below)
2. Identify actual root cause (if any)
3. Either close epic (no problem) or rewrite based on real findings
4. Consider dependency on Epic 8 (database population may be root cause)

## Epic Goal

~~Fix MCP tool registration for getEndpointCategories method so it appears in the available tools list and becomes accessible to MCP clients like Claude Desktop, completing Epic 6.2 delivery.~~

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Initial analysis revealed getEndpointCategories is ALREADY REGISTERED. Epic premise may be invalid. Investigation required to identify actual root cause.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: MCP server with 3 registered tools (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample)
- Technology stack: Python 3.11+, FastMCP framework for tool registration, MCP SDK 1.0+
- Integration points: FastMCP tool decorator system, mcp_server_v2.py tool registration, MCP protocol tools/list method
- Current limitation: getEndpointCategories method implemented but not registered as MCP tool

**Problem Analysis:**

**Problem: Implemented Method Not Accessible via MCP Protocol**

The `getEndpointCategories` method was implemented as part of Epic 6.2 but is missing from the MCP tools list:

**Current Tools List (Missing getEndpointCategories):**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {"name": "searchEndpoints", ...},    ‚úÖ Registered
      {"name": "getSchema", ...},          ‚úÖ Registered
      {"name": "getExample", ...}          ‚úÖ Registered
      // ‚ùå getEndpointCategories MISSING
    ]
  }
}
```

**Evidence from Production Logs:**

Server initialization at 2025-09-30 20:58:46 UTC shows only 3 tools in response to `tools/list` request. Throughout 38 subsequent requests in the session, there are ZERO calls to `getEndpointCategories`, confirming clients cannot discover or use the method.

**Impact Analysis:**

1. **Epic 6.2 Blocked Despite Implementation:**
   - Method code exists but is completely inaccessible
   - Users cannot discover categories via MCP protocol
   - Progressive disclosure workflow broken
   - Token efficiency benefits of categorization unavailable

2. **User Experience Degradation:**
   - No category navigation in Claude Desktop
   - Cannot explore API structure hierarchically
   - Missing metadata for large APIs (40+ endpoints)
   - Must rely on flat searchEndpoints results

3. **Documentation Inconsistency:**
   - Story 6.2 marked "Complete" but feature not working
   - Tests may pass but integration is broken
   - QA gates passed without verifying MCP registration

**Root Cause Analysis:**

**Primary Hypothesis: Missing @mcp.tool() Decorator**

The FastMCP framework requires the `@mcp.tool()` decorator for methods to be exposed as MCP tools.

**Suspect Code Pattern in `src/swagger_mcp_server/server/mcp_server_v2.py`:**

```python
# ‚úÖ Correctly registered tools:

@mcp.tool()
async def searchEndpoints(query: str, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: int = 10):
    """Search API endpoints..."""
    # Implementation

@mcp.tool()
async def getSchema(schema_name: str, include_examples: bool = True):
    """Get detailed schema definition..."""
    # Implementation

@mcp.tool()
async def getExample(endpoint_id: str, language: str = "curl"):
    """Generate code examples..."""
    # Implementation

# ‚ùå Missing decorator:

async def getEndpointCategories():  # ‚ùå No @mcp.tool() decorator
    """Get list of endpoint categories..."""
    # Implementation exists but not registered
```

**Secondary Hypothesis: Method Not in Server Scope**

Method might be implemented in a helper module but not imported or bound to the MCP server instance.

**Tertiary Hypothesis: Conditional Registration**

Method might be registered conditionally based on disabled feature flags:
```python
if config.enable_categories:  # ‚ùå Maybe False?
    @mcp.tool()
    async def getEndpointCategories():
        ...
```

**Enhancement Details:**

**What's being fixed:**

1. **Add @mcp.tool() Decorator**
   - Add FastMCP tool decorator to getEndpointCategories method
   - Ensure method is in correct scope for registration
   - Verify decorator arguments match other tools

2. **Method Signature Validation**
   - Verify method signature follows FastMCP conventions
   - Add proper type hints for MCP schema generation
   - Ensure docstring format matches other tools

3. **MCP Schema Generation**
   - Verify inputSchema is generated correctly
   - Test optional parameters (include_counts, include_methods)
   - Validate return type schema

4. **Server Regeneration and Testing**
   - Regenerate generated MCP servers from template
   - Verify method appears in tools/list response
   - Test method accessibility via MCP clients

**How it integrates:**

- Adds @mcp.tool() decorator to existing method implementation
- No changes to method logic or functionality
- No database changes required
- No API contract changes (purely registration fix)
- Generated MCP servers automatically include method after regeneration
- Maintains consistency with existing tool registration patterns

**Success criteria:**

- getEndpointCategories appears in MCP tools list on server initialization
- Method is callable via MCP protocol
- Method returns expected data format (list of category objects)
- Integration tests verify tool registration
- Generated servers include the method automatically
- Claude Desktop can discover and call the method
- All 4 tools (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample, getEndpointCategories) appear in tools/list

## Stories (‚ö†Ô∏è ALL REQUIRE REWRITE BASED ON INVESTIGATION)

**Current Status:** üî¥ **ALL STORIES BLOCKED** - Based on false assumptions

**Original Stories (INVALID):**

1. ~~**Story 1: Add @mcp.tool() Decorator and Validate Registration**~~ ‚ùå INVALID
   - ~~Locate getEndpointCategories method~~ ‚úÖ Already exists
   - ~~Add @mcp.tool() decorator~~ ‚ùå Framework not used
   - ~~Verify registration~~ ‚úÖ Already registered (native MCP SDK)
   - **SM Bob Score:** 0/100 - Story completely invalid

2. ~~**Story 2: Regenerate Servers and Validate MCP Protocol Integration**~~ ‚ùå INVALID
   - ~~Regenerate Ozon MCP server~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è May already include method
   - ~~Verify tools/list response~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è Likely already returns 4 tools
   - ~~Test MCP protocol~~ ‚úÖ Useful for validation
   - **SM Bob Score:** 0/100 - Depends on invalid Story 9.1

3. ~~**Story 3: End-to-End Testing with Real MCP Clients**~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è SALVAGEABLE
   - ~~Test fix with Claude Desktop~~ ‚ùå No fix to test
   - ‚úÖ Production validation ‚Üê **THIS IS VALUABLE**
   - ‚úÖ Log monitoring ‚Üê **THIS IS VALUABLE**
   - **SM Bob Score:** 30/100 - Rewrite as investigation task

**Revised Stories (POST-INVESTIGATION):**

**Prerequisites:** Complete Epic 9 Investigation Checklist (below) ‚Üí Identify actual root cause

**If Problem Exists:**
1. **Story 9.1 (Revised): [Root Cause Fix]** - TBD based on investigation findings
2. **Story 9.2 (Revised): [Validation & Testing]** - TBD based on fix approach
3. **Story 9.3 (Revised): Production Validation & Monitoring** - Verify fix in Claude Desktop

**If No Problem Exists:**
- Close Epic 9 as "Invalid - Feature already works"
- Update documentation to reflect correct architecture
- Add investigation learnings to technical debt registry

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing tool registrations (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample) remain unchanged
- [x] No breaking changes to method implementation or signature
- [x] No database schema changes required
- [x] No MCP protocol changes required
- [x] Generated servers maintain backward compatibility
- [x] Tool registration follows existing FastMCP patterns

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Incorrect decorator usage could break server initialization
- **Mitigation:** Follow exact pattern from existing tools, comprehensive testing before deployment, rollback plan ready
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove decorator, regenerate servers, server continues with 3 tools (current state)

**Secondary Risk:** Method implementation might have issues only discovered after registration

- **Mitigation:** Thorough testing with various inputs, validate against database (requires Issue #002 fix), error handling for empty categories

**Tertiary Risk:** Generated servers might not inherit fix automatically

- **Mitigation:** Verify template generation process, test regeneration with multiple APIs, update generation documentation

## Definition of Done

‚ö†Ô∏è **ORIGINAL DoD IS INVALID - REQUIRES INVESTIGATION FIRST**

**New Investigation Phase DoD:**
- [ ] Root cause analysis completed (production logs, Claude Desktop testing, database verification)
- [ ] Actual problem identified and documented
- [ ] Epic premise validated or refuted with evidence
- [ ] If premise valid: Epic rewritten with correct technical approach
- [ ] If premise invalid: Epic closed or redirected to actual problem
- [ ] Dependencies identified (e.g., Epic 8 completion required)
- [ ] New stories drafted based on actual findings

**Original DoD (SUSPENDED):**
- ~~@mcp.tool() decorator added~~ ‚ùå Framework doesn't use decorators
- ~~Method signature validated~~ ‚ùå Method already exists
- ~~Docstring updated~~ ‚ùå Already documented
- ~~getEndpointCategories in tools/list~~ ‚úÖ Already registered (lines 267-297)
- ~~Method callable via MCP~~ ‚úÖ Already callable (lines 344-347, 1569-1604)
- ~~Unit test verifies registration~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è Test may already pass
- ~~Integration test~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è May already work
- ~~Ozon server regenerated~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è May already include it
- ~~Claude Desktop tested~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs testing to verify actual issue
- ~~QA gates updated~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends on findings
- ~~No regression~~ ‚úÖ Tool already registered correctly

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural changes required (decorator addition only)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing tool registration patterns
- [x] Integration complexity is minimal (single decorator + testing)

**Risk Assessment:**

- [x] Risk to existing system is low (additive change)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (remove decorator)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality (regression suite)
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of FastMCP tool registration

**Completeness Check:**

- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable (register MCP tool)
- [x] Stories are properly scoped for progressive delivery
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (4 tools in tools/list)
- [x] Dependencies are identified (FastMCP decorator, tool registration)

## Technical Analysis Appendix

### Current Tool Registration Pattern (Working Examples)

**File:** `src/swagger_mcp_server/server/mcp_server_v2.py`

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from typing import Optional

            if include_counts:
                cat_dict["count"] = category.endpoint_count or 0

            if include_methods:
                cat_dict["methods"] = category.http_methods or []

            result.append(cat_dict)

        return result

### Registration Verification Tests

**Unit Test: Tool Registration**

```python
def test_get_endpoint_categories_registered():
    """Verify getEndpointCategories is registered as MCP tool"""
    from swagger_mcp_server.server.mcp_server_v2 import mcp

    tools = mcp.list_tools()
    tool_names = [t["name"] for t in tools]

    assert "getEndpointCategories" in tool_names
    assert len(tool_names) == 4  # searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample, getEndpointCategories

def test_get_endpoint_categories_schema():
    """Verify getEndpointCategories has correct MCP schema"""
    from swagger_mcp_server.server.mcp_server_v2 import mcp

    tools = mcp.list_tools()
    get_cats = next(t for t in tools if t["name"] == "getEndpointCategories")

    assert "description" in get_cats
    assert "inputSchema" in get_cats
    assert get_cats["inputSchema"]["type"] == "object"
    assert "include_counts" in get_cats["inputSchema"]["properties"]
    assert "include_methods" in get_cats["inputSchema"]["properties"]
```

**Integration Test: MCP Protocol**

```python
async def test_get_endpoint_categories_callable_via_mcp():
    """Verify getEndpointCategories can be called via MCP protocol"""
    # Simulate MCP client request
    response = await mcp_server.call_tool("getEndpointCategories", {
        "include_counts": True,
        "include_methods": True
    })

    assert isinstance(response, list)
    # Note: May be empty if Issue #002 not fixed yet
    # assert len(response) > 0  # Uncomment after Issue #002 resolved
    if len(response) > 0:
        assert "name" in response[0]
        assert "display_name" in response[0]
        assert "count" in response[0]
        assert "methods" in response[0]
```

**End-to-End Test: Claude Desktop**

```python
async def test_claude_desktop_integration():
    """Verify Claude Desktop can discover and call getEndpointCategories"""
    # Requires real Claude Desktop instance
    client = MCPClient()
    await client.connect("ozon-api")

    # List tools
    tools = await client.list_tools()
    tool_names = [t.name for t in tools]

    assert "getEndpointCategories" in tool_names

### FastMCP Tool Registration Reference

**Documentation:** https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp

**Key Points:**
1. `@mcp.tool()` decorator must be applied to async functions
2. Type hints are required for automatic schema generation
3. Docstring format: One-line summary, blank line, Args section, Returns section
4. Default parameter values are preserved in schema
5. Tool name defaults to function name (use `@mcp.tool(name="customName")` to override)

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this MCP tool registration fix epic. Key considerations:

- This is a registration bug where implemented method is not accessible via MCP protocol
- Integration points: FastMCP decorator system, mcp_server_v2.py tool registration, MCP tools/list protocol
- Existing patterns to follow: @mcp.tool() decorator, method signature conventions, docstring format
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must not break existing tool registrations, follow FastMCP conventions, maintain backward compatibility
- Each story must include verification that existing tools (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample) remain accessible
- Testing target: All 4 tools appear in tools/list, method callable via MCP clients, Claude Desktop integration works

The epic should restore MCP accessibility while maintaining system integrity and existing tool functionality."

## üîç INVESTIGATION CHECKLIST (Required Before Epic Rewrite)

**Assigned To:** Product Owner / Business Analyst
**Due Date:** Before Epic 9 can proceed
**Status:** Not Started

### Phase 1: Code Verification (30 min)

- [ ] **Verify Tool Registration in Source Code**
  - [ ] Check `mcp_server_v2.py` lines 267-297 for types.Tool registration
  - [ ] Verify tool appears in list_tools() response
  - [ ] Confirm method handler exists (lines 1569-1604)
  - [ ] Document: Tool IS/IS NOT registered in source code

- [ ] **Verify MCP Framework Used**
  - [ ] Check imports: Native MCP SDK vs FastMCP
  - [ ] Document actual framework: `from mcp import types, Server`
  - [ ] Confirm: ~~FastMCP~~ ‚ùå NOT USED

### Phase 2: Runtime Testing (1 hour)

- [ ] **Test Server Startup**
  ```bash
  cd /Users/r2d2/Documents/Code_Projects/spacechemical-nextjs/bmad-openapi-mcp-server
  python -m swagger_mcp_server.server.mcp_server_v2
  ```
  - [ ] Server starts without errors: YES / NO
  - [ ] Check logs for tool registration
  - [ ] Count tools in list: Expected 4, Actual: ___

- [ ] **Test Generated Server**
  ```bash
  cd generated-mcp-servers/ozon-mcp-server
  python server.py
  ```
  - [ ] Generated server starts: YES / NO
  - [ ] getEndpointCategories in tools list: YES / NO
  - [ ] Tool count: ___

- [ ] **Test in Claude Desktop**
  - [ ] Connect to ozon-api server
  - [ ] Ask: "What API categories are available?"
  - [ ] Tool is called: YES / NO
  - [ ] Response received: YES / NO / EMPTY
  - [ ] If empty, check database for categories

### Phase 3: Database Verification (15 min)

- [ ] **Check Categories Table Population**
  ```bash
  sqlite3 generated-mcp-servers/ozon-mcp-server/data/mcp_server.db
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM endpoint_categories;
  ```
  - [ ] Table exists: YES / NO
  - [ ] Record count: ___ (Expected: 6 for Ozon API)
  - [ ] If 0 records ‚Üí **Root cause is Epic 8, not Epic 9**

### Phase 4: Production Log Analysis (30 min)

- [ ] **Review Production Logs**
  ```bash
  cat /Users/r2d2/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-ozon-api.log | grep getEndpointCategories
  ```
  - [ ] Method is called: YES / NO / Never logged
  - [ ] Errors present: YES / NO
  - [ ] Error messages: ___________________
  - [ ] Success rate: ____%

### Phase 5: Root Cause Determination

**Evidence:** _____________________________________________

**Recommended Action:**
- [ ] Close Epic 9 (no problem exists)
- [ ] Redirect to Epic 8 (database population needed)
- [ ] Rewrite Epic 9 (different technical approach)
- [ ] Create new epic (different problem)

**Dependencies Identified:** ___________________________________

**Estimated Effort for Real Fix:** ___ hours/days

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DEVELOPER NOTE

**DO NOT PROCEED with Stories 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3 until investigation complete.**

All three stories are based on potentially false assumptions:
- Story 9.1 assumes FastMCP decorator needed (framework not used)
- Story 9.2 assumes server regeneration needed (may already work)
- Story 9.3 assumes testing a fix (no fix may be needed)

**Wait for investigation results before any development work.**

## üìä SM Bob Technical Review Summary (2025-10-01)

**Epic Quality Score: 0/100** ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

**Review Outcome:** üî¥ **EPIC BLOCKED - COMPLETE REWRITE REQUIRED**

### Critical Issues Identified

**Issue 1: Framework Misidentification** ‚ùå
- **Epic Assumes:** FastMCP framework with @mcp.tool() decorator pattern
- **Actual Reality:** Native MCP SDK with types.Tool registration
- **Evidence:** mcp_server_v2.py imports `from mcp import types, Server` (NOT FastMCP)
- **Impact:** Entire Epic 9 technical approach is invalid

**Issue 2: Feature Already Implemented** ‚úÖ
- **Epic Assumes:** getEndpointCategories not registered as MCP tool
- **Actual Reality:** Tool IS registered (lines 267-297 in mcp_server_v2.py)
- **Evidence:**
  ```python
  types.Tool(
      name="getEndpointCategories",
      description="Retrieve hierarchical catalog...",
      inputSchema={...}
  )
  ```
- **Impact:** Problem does not exist as stated in epic

**Issue 3: Root Cause Unknown** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Epic Assumes:** Registration issue causing method inaccessibility
- **Actual Reality:** Method is registered and implemented - real problem unknown
- **Likely Causes:**
  1. Database empty (Epic 8 dependency - most likely)
  2. Deployment/configuration issue
  3. Claude Desktop config pointing to wrong server
  4. Server not starting correctly
  5. No problem exists (feature works fine)

### Story-by-Story Assessment

| Story | Original Score | Status | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| **9.1** | 0/100 ‚ùå | INVALID | Rewrite or close |
| **9.2** | 0/100 ‚ùå | INVALID | Depends on 9.1 |
| **9.3** | 30/100 ‚ö†Ô∏è | SALVAGEABLE | Rewrite as investigation |

### Recommended Actions

**Immediate Actions (Before Any Development):**
1. ‚úÖ Complete Epic 9 Investigation Checklist (estimated 2 hours)
2. ‚úÖ Test getEndpointCategories in Claude Desktop (current state)
3. ‚úÖ Verify database has categories (Epic 8 dependency check)
4. ‚úÖ Review production logs for actual errors
5. ‚úÖ Document findings with evidence

**Post-Investigation Options:**

**Option A: Problem Doesn't Exist**
- Close Epic 9 as "Invalid - Feature already implemented and working"
- Update architecture documentation to reflect correct MCP SDK usage
- Add learnings to technical debt knowledge base
- **Effort:** 0 hours (documentation only)

**Option B: Database Empty (Epic 8 Dependency)**
- Close Epic 9 as "Duplicate - Root cause is Epic 8"
- Complete Epic 8 first (category database population)
- Retest getEndpointCategories after Epic 8 completion
- **Effort:** Redirected to Epic 8

**Option C: Real Configuration/Deployment Issue Found**
- Rewrite Epic 9 with correct technical approach
- Create new stories based on actual findings
- Implement and test fix
- **Effort:** TBD based on issue complexity

**Option D: Real Code Issue Found (Different Than Assumed)**
- Document actual problem with evidence
- Rewrite Epic 9 with correct root cause
- Create targeted fix stories
- **Effort:** TBD based on issue type

### Dependencies and Blockers

**Blockers:**
- üî¥ Investigation checklist must be completed first
- üî¥ Epic 8 completion may be prerequisite
- üî¥ All current stories blocked until rewrite

**Dependencies:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Epic 8 (category database population) likely required
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production environment access for testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Claude Desktop configuration

### Risk Assessment

**Current Risk Level:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

**Risks:**
1. **Wasted Development Effort:** Implementing invalid stories wastes 8-12 hours
2. **False Fix:** "Fixing" non-existent problem creates confusion
3. **Missed Real Issue:** Focusing on wrong problem delays actual fix
4. **Technical Debt:** Incorrect architecture assumptions propagate

**Mitigation:**
- ‚úÖ HALT all development on Epic 9 immediately
- ‚úÖ Prioritize investigation over implementation
- ‚úÖ Wait for Epic 8 completion before retesting
- ‚úÖ Validate assumptions before creating stories

### Quality Process Learnings

**What Went Wrong:**
1. Initial analysis made assumptions about framework without code verification
2. Did not verify tool registration in actual code before writing epic
3. Skipped runtime testing to validate problem exists
4. Created stories before confirming root cause

**What Went Right:**
1. ‚úÖ SM technical review caught issues before development started
2. ‚úÖ Clear evidence provided for why epic is invalid
3. ‚úÖ Investigation checklist created to find real problem
4. ‚úÖ Blocked stories to prevent wasted effort

**Process Improvements:**
1. **Mandatory Code Verification:** Always verify assumptions against actual code
2. **Runtime Testing First:** Test problem exists before creating epic
3. **Framework Validation:** Confirm framework/library usage before planning approach
4. **Incremental Validation:** Small investigation story before full epic

### Estimated Timeline

**Investigation Phase:** 2 hours
**Decision Point:** Close vs Rewrite vs Redirect
**If Rewrite Needed:** 4-8 hours (TBD based on findings)
**If Close:** 1 hour (documentation update)
**If Redirect to Epic 8:** 0 hours (blocked until Epic 8 complete)

### Stakeholder Communication

**Message to Product Owner:**
> Epic 9 is based on incorrect assumptions about the codebase. The tool registration issue does not exist as described. Before proceeding, we need a 2-hour investigation to identify if there's a real problem and what it is. Most likely, this is an Epic 8 dependency (empty database) rather than a registration issue.

**Message to Development Team:**
> Do not implement Stories 9.1, 9.2, or 9.3 as written. They're based on a false premise. Wait for investigation results and epic rewrite before starting any work.

**Message to QA:**
> Epic 9 QA gates should be suspended until epic is rewritten. Focus QA efforts on Epic 8 validation instead.

---

## Conclusion

Epic 9 requires immediate halt and investigation before any development proceeds. The epic is well-intentioned but based on incorrect technical assumptions about the codebase architecture. A 2-hour investigation will determine the real status and appropriate next steps.

**Quality Gate:** üî¥ **FAILED - DO NOT PROCEED TO DEVELOPMENT**

**Next Review:** After investigation checklist completion

**Approval Status:** ‚ùå **NOT APPROVED FOR DEVELOPMENT**
