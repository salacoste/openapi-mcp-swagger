# Epic 5: GitHub Pages Documentation Site - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Create a comprehensive GitHub Pages website that showcases our Universal Swagger → MCP Server Converter project with clear documentation, practical examples, and compelling demonstration of the problem we solve and technical value we deliver.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: BMAD-METHOD based project with structured documentation in docs/ hierarchy
- Technology stack: BMAD framework, planned MCP implementation, existing markdown documentation
- Integration points: docs/prd/, docs/architecture/, existing project structure

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Static GitHub Pages website (classic GitHub Pages, no Next.js) that presents our project professionally
- How it integrates: Leverages existing docs/ structure, presents content in user-friendly format
- Success criteria: Professional website with complete documentation coverage, usage examples, problem explanation, and technical implementation details

## Stories

1. **Story 1: GitHub Pages Foundation & Problem Presentation**
   - Set up classic GitHub Pages infrastructure
   - Create landing page explaining the problem we solve (API documentation context window limitations)
   - Design navigation structure for all documentation sections

2. **Story 2: Technical Documentation & Implementation Details**
   - Convert existing technical documentation to user-friendly format
   - Create detailed implementation guides and architecture explanations
   - Add technical specifications and API reference

3. **Story 3: Examples, Demos & Value Demonstration**
   - Create practical usage examples with real Swagger files
   - Build interactive examples showing before/after scenarios
   - Add compelling demonstrations of value proposition

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing documentation structure remains unchanged
- [x] BMAD framework patterns are preserved
- [x] Project development workflow continues uninterrupted
- [x] Documentation maintenance overhead is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Additional maintenance overhead for keeping GitHub Pages synchronized with project documentation
- **Mitigation:** Automated synchronization where possible, clear documentation update processes
- **Rollback Plan:** GitHub Pages can be disabled without affecting main project functionality

## Definition of Done

- [x] Professional GitHub Pages site is live and accessible
- [x] All project documentation is covered and well-presented
- [x] Usage examples and demos are functional and compelling
- [x] Problem explanation and value proposition are clear
- [x] Technical implementation details are comprehensive
- [x] Site navigation is intuitive and user-friendly
- [x] Existing project documentation workflow remains intact

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

✅ Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
✅ No architectural documentation is required (enhancement only)
✅ Enhancement follows existing documentation patterns
✅ Integration complexity is manageable (static site generation)

**Risk Assessment:**

✅ Risk to existing system is low (additive enhancement)
✅ Rollback plan is feasible (disable GitHub Pages)
✅ Testing approach covers existing functionality (documentation remains unchanged)
✅ Team has sufficient knowledge of GitHub Pages and static sites

**Completeness Check:**

✅ Epic goal is clear and achievable
✅ Stories are properly scoped for progressive delivery
✅ Success criteria are measurable
✅ Dependencies are identified (existing docs structure)

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing BMAD-METHOD project with structured documentation
- Integration points: docs/prd/, docs/architecture/, existing markdown files, project configuration
- Existing patterns to follow: BMAD documentation standards, existing project structure
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must not disrupt existing development workflow, should leverage existing documentation
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain project integrity while delivering a professional GitHub Pages presence that effectively communicates our project's value and technical implementation."
