# Story 2.3: getSchema MCP Method Implementation

## Story Overview
**Epic**: Epic 2 - MCP Server Implementation & Protocol Compliance
**Story ID**: 2.3
**Story Type**: Core Feature
**Complexity**: High
**Sprint**: TBD

## User Story
As an AI agent,
I want to retrieve complete schema definitions with their dependencies,
So that I can understand data structures required for API integration.

## Story Context

### Business Value
- Enables AI agents to understand complex data structures and API contracts
- Provides complete schema information including nested dependencies and references
- Resolves OpenAPI $ref references automatically for comprehensive data understanding
- Critical for AI agents to generate accurate integration code with proper data types

### Dependencies
**Depends On:**
- Story 2.1: MCP Protocol Foundation Setup (MCP server framework operational)
- Story 1.4: Basic Storage Layer Implementation (schema data in database)
- Story 1.3: Schema Normalization Engine (normalized schema structure with references)

**Enables:**
- Story 2.4: getExample MCP Method Implementation (uses schema data for code generation)
- Story 3.5: Schema and Component Search Integration (enhanced schema search)

### Technical Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Schema tables from Epic 1.3 normalization, component references and dependencies
- Technology: Python with recursive schema resolution, circular reference detection
- Follows pattern: Database relationship navigation and foreign key resolution from storage layer
- Touch points: Schema tables, component references, OpenAPI $ref resolution, circular dependency handling

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Method Implementation and Parameter Validation**
   - Implement `getSchema(componentName)` as MCP protocol method
   - Validate `componentName` parameter (string, required, valid OpenAPI component name)
   - Handle component name variations: full paths vs. short names (e.g., "User" vs "#/components/schemas/User")
   - Return descriptive error for non-existent component names

2. **Complete Schema Retrieval**
   - Return complete schema definition with all properties, types, validation rules
   - Include schema examples, default values, and format specifications
   - Preserve OpenAPI schema extensions (x-* properties) from original specification
   - Handle both object schemas and primitive type definitions

3. **Automatic Dependency Resolution**
   - Resolve all $ref references to their complete schema definitions
   - Include nested schema dependencies up to reasonable depth (10 levels max)
   - Handle allOf, oneOf, anyOf schema composition patterns
   - Support array item schemas and additional properties schemas

### Integration Requirements
4. **Database Schema Navigation**
   - Use existing schema normalization from Epic 1.3 without database changes
   - Leverage existing foreign key relationships for dependency traversal
   - Maintain existing database connection pooling and transaction patterns
   - Query optimization for complex schema dependency trees

5. **Circular Reference Handling**
   - Detect circular references in schema dependencies (A → B → A)
   - Prevent infinite loops in dependency resolution algorithm
   - Return partial schema with reference placeholders for circular dependencies
   - Log circular reference detection for debugging and monitoring

6. **MCP Protocol Response Integration**
   - Format response according to MCP protocol JSON standards
   - Include complete schema tree in single response to minimize round trips
   - Handle large schema responses efficiently (up to 100KB per schema)
   - Provide schema metadata: source file, last updated, version information

### Quality Requirements
7. **Performance Requirements**
   - Achieve <500ms response time for schema retrieval per NFR1
   - Handle complex schemas with deep dependency trees efficiently
   - Database query optimization for multi-table schema joins
   - Memory-efficient schema tree construction for large schemas

8. **Schema Accuracy and Completeness**
   - Preserve 100% of original OpenAPI schema information during retrieval
   - Validate schema structure consistency after dependency resolution
   - Handle edge cases: missing references, malformed schemas, incomplete data
   - Provide informative error messages for schema resolution failures

9. **Concurrent Access and Caching**
   - Support concurrent schema requests from multiple AI agents
   - Implement schema caching for frequently requested components
   - Cache invalidation when underlying schema data changes
   - Thread-safe schema resolution for high-concurrency scenarios

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Schema Resolution Algorithm
```python
async def getSchema(componentName: str) -> MCPResponse:
    """
    Retrieve complete schema with all dependencies resolved

    Args:
        componentName: OpenAPI component name (e.g., "User" or "#/components/schemas/User")

    Returns:
        MCPResponse with complete schema definition and resolved dependencies
    """
    # 1. Validate and normalize component name
    # 2. Retrieve base schema from database
    # 3. Recursively resolve all $ref dependencies
    # 4. Detect and handle circular references
    # 5. Construct complete schema tree
    # 6. Format as MCP protocol response
```

### Dependency Resolution Strategy
- **Breadth-First Traversal**: Resolve schema dependencies level by level
- **Circular Detection**: Track visited schemas to detect circular references
- **Reference Cache**: Cache resolved schemas within single request to avoid duplicate resolution
- **Error Resilience**: Continue resolution even if some dependencies fail to resolve

### Response Format Example
```json
{
  "schema": {
    "name": "User",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "uuid",
        "description": "Unique user identifier"
      },
      "profile": {
        "$ref": "#/components/schemas/UserProfile",
        "resolved": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "firstName": {"type": "string"},
            "lastName": {"type": "string"}
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["id", "profile"]
  },
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "name": "UserProfile",
      "type": "object",
      "source": "#/components/schemas/UserProfile"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "circular_references": [],
    "resolution_depth": 3,
    "total_dependencies": 5
  }
}
```

### Circular Reference Handling
- **Detection**: Maintain stack of currently resolving schemas
- **Prevention**: Stop resolution when circular reference detected
- **Reporting**: Include circular reference information in response metadata
- **Fallback**: Return schema stub with reference placeholder for circular dependencies

## Definition of Done

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk** - Complex dependency resolution and circular reference handling

**Primary Risks:**
- Circular reference detection algorithm complexity affecting performance
- Deep dependency trees causing memory usage spikes
- Database query optimization for complex multi-table joins
- Schema resolution accuracy for complex OpenAPI compositions (allOf, oneOf, anyOf)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with simple schemas and incrementally add complexity
- Implement depth limits and timeout protection for dependency resolution
- Use existing database relationship patterns to minimize query complexity
- Comprehensive testing with real-world OpenAPI specifications
- Schema resolution caching to improve performance and reduce database load

**Rollback Plan:**
- Disable getSchema method in MCP server capability advertisement
- Return "method not implemented" error response until issues resolved
- Other MCP methods (searchEndpoints) remain fully operational
- Database schema and normalization remain unchanged

## Story Estimation
**Complexity**: High
**Effort**: 4-5 development sessions (16-20 hours)
**Risk Level**: High
**Dependencies**: 3 (Stories 2.1, 1.4, 1.3)
