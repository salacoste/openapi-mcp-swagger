## Dev Notes

### Technology Requirements
- **Pipeline orchestration**: Async/await for concurrent operations
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and rollback
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging and metrics collection
- **Performance**: Process 262KB file within 60 seconds (AC: 2)
- **Reliability**: Transaction support for data integrity
- **Scalability**: Batch processing for multiple files

### Architecture Integration
Based on approved source tree structure:
- **Location**: `src/swagger_mcp_server/pipeline.py` or dedicated `pipeline/` module
- **Dependencies**: Stream parser (1.2), normalization (1.3), storage (1.4)
- **Output**: Complete Swagger-to-database conversion capability
- **Integration**: Foundation for MCP server implementation (Epic 2)

### Pipeline Architecture Design
```python
class SwaggerProcessingPipeline:
    async def process_file(self, file_path: str) -> ProcessingResult
    async def process_batch(self, file_paths: List[str]) -> BatchProcessingResult
    async def validate_integrity(self, api_id: int) -> IntegrityReport

class ProcessingStage(ABC):
    async def execute(self, input_data: Any, context: PipelineContext) -> StageResult
    async def rollback(self, context: PipelineContext) -> None

class PipelineContext:
    api_id: Optional[int]
    file_path: str
    metrics: ProcessingMetrics
    transaction: DatabaseTransaction
```

### Performance Requirements
- **Processing speed**: 262KB Ozon API file within 60 seconds
- **Memory efficiency**: Handle large files without memory overflow
- **Database performance**: Efficient bulk insertion and indexing
- **Concurrent processing**: Support multiple files in parallel
- **Progress reporting**: Real-time progress updates during processing
- **Resource utilization**: Optimal use of CPU, memory, and I/O

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Stage isolation**: Failures in one stage don't corrupt others
- **Transaction rollback**: Database changes reverted on failures
- **Partial recovery**: Continue processing recoverable sections
- **Error aggregation**: Collect and report all errors systematically
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
- **Cleanup procedures**: Resource cleanup after failures

### Monitoring and Metrics
- **Processing metrics**: Duration, memory usage, throughput
- **Quality metrics**: Completeness, accuracy, consistency scores
- **Error metrics**: Error rates, types, recovery success rates
- **Performance metrics**: Stage timing, bottleneck identification
- **Business metrics**: Files processed, success rates, data quality
- **Operational metrics**: Resource utilization, system health

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests**: Individual pipeline components and stages
- **Integration tests**: Full pipeline with real Swagger files
- **Performance tests**: Large file processing within time limits
- **Stress tests**: Resource constraints and concurrent operations
- **Error simulation**: Failure injection and recovery validation
- **Data validation**: End-to-end data integrity verification

### Sample Data for Testing
- **Ozon API (262KB)**: Primary performance validation target
- **Small files**: Quick testing and development (< 50KB)
- **Large files**: Stress testing with enterprise APIs (1-10MB)
- **Complex files**: APIs with deep nesting and many references
- **Edge cases**: Unusual structures, extensions, malformed data
- **Batch sets**: Multiple files for concurrent processing tests

### Data Integrity Validation
- **Completeness**: All endpoints, schemas, security definitions preserved
- **Accuracy**: No data corruption or modification during processing
- **Consistency**: Relationships and references properly maintained
- **Semantic preservation**: OpenAPI semantics correctly interpreted
- **Extension preservation**: All vendor extensions maintained
- **Quality scoring**: Automated quality assessment and reporting
