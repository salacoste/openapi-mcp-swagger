# Story 5.1: GitHub Pages Foundation & Problem Presentation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** potential user or contributor,
**I want** a professional GitHub Pages website that clearly explains the problem our Universal Swagger → MCP Server Converter solves,
**so that** I can quickly understand the value proposition and navigate to relevant documentation sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Pages is configured and accessible at standard GitHub Pages URL
2. Landing page clearly explains the context window limitation problem with API documentation
3. Navigation structure covers all major documentation sections (Architecture, API Reference, Examples, Getting Started)
4. Problem explanation includes before/after scenarios showing MCP server benefits
5. Landing page includes clear value proposition with concrete benefits
6. Site follows consistent design theme and branding
7. All internal navigation links work correctly
8. Site is mobile-responsive and accessibility compliant
9. Landing page loads within 3 seconds on standard connections

### Problem Context for Landing Page
Based on project documentation, the core problem is:
- **Context Window Limitations**: Large Swagger/OpenAPI files (200KB+) consume entire AI context windows
- **Search Inefficiency**: No intelligent search across API endpoints, schemas, and examples
- **Manual Documentation Review**: Developers must manually parse large JSON files to understand APIs
- **Integration Complexity**: Direct Swagger consumption by AI agents is resource-intensive and ineffective

### Value Proposition Elements
- **Intelligent Search**: BM25/vector search across endpoints, schemas, components
- **Context Efficiency**: Provide only relevant API sections instead of entire Swagger file
- **Multi-format Examples**: Auto-generate cURL, JavaScript, Python code examples
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard interface for AI agents to query API documentation

### Technology Stack for Pages
- **GitHub Pages**: Jekyll static site generator
- **Responsive Framework**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for mobile-first design
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- **Performance**: Optimized for <3s load time on 3G connections

### Navigation Structure Plan
1. **Home** - Problem explanation and value proposition
2. **Getting Started** - Quick setup and usage guide
3. **Documentation** - Technical architecture and implementation
4. **API Reference** - MCP method specifications
5. **Examples** - Real-world usage scenarios and code samples
6. **Contributing** - Development setup and contribution guidelines

### Design Requirements
- **Professional Appearance**: Clean, modern design reflecting technical quality
- **Clear Information Hierarchy**: F-pattern layout for scannable content
- **Consistent Branding**: Unified color scheme and typography
- **Fast Loading**: Minimal dependencies, optimized assets
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Testing Standards
- **Accessibility Testing**: Use axe-core or WAVE for automated accessibility scanning
- **Performance Testing**: Use Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, and SEO scoring
- **Responsive Testing**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Validate functionality across major browsers
- **HTML/CSS Validation**: Use W3C validators for standards compliance
