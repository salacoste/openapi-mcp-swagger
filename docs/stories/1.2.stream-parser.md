# Story 1.2: Stream-based JSON Parser Implementation

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** system,
**I want** to parse large OpenAPI/Swagger JSON files efficiently without memory constraints,
**so that** enterprise-scale API documentation (up to 10MB) can be processed reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement stream-based JSON parser using ijson library for memory-efficient processing
2. Handle malformed JSON gracefully with descriptive error messages and recovery options
3. Preserve complete OpenAPI structure during parsing without data loss
4. Process files up to 10MB within 2GB RAM footprint as specified in NFR2
5. Validate OpenAPI 3.x specification compliance during parsing
6. Support incremental parsing with progress reporting for large files

  - [x] Add OpenAPI version detection (3.0.x, 3.1.x)
  - [x] Implement schema validation with detailed error reporting
  - [x] Add support for OpenAPI extensions validation
  - [x] Create validation result reporting with warnings and errors

- [x] Add progress reporting system (AC: 6)
  - [x] Implement progress callback interface
  - [x] Add byte-level progress tracking during parsing
  - [x] Create progress events for different parsing phases
  - [x] Add time estimation for remaining parsing work
  - [x] Implement cancellation support for long-running parses

- [x] Create comprehensive tests (All ACs)
  - [x] Unit tests for parser components with 85%+ coverage
  - [x] Performance tests with 10MB file processing validation
  - [x] Error handling tests with malformed JSON scenarios
  - [x] Memory usage tests confirming 2GB RAM limit compliance
  - [x] Integration tests with real Swagger files from data/samples

## Dev Notes

### Technology Requirements
- **ijson library**: Stream-based JSON parsing for memory efficiency
- **openapi-spec-validator**: OpenAPI 3.x specification compliance validation
- **Memory management**: Must process 10MB files within 2GB RAM (NFR2)
- **Performance target**: Parse files efficiently with progress reporting
- **Error resilience**: Graceful handling of malformed JSON with recovery

### Architecture Integration
Based on approved source tree structure:
- **Location**: `src/swagger_mcp_server/parser/` module
- **Core files**: `swagger_parser.py`, `stream_parser.py`, `base.py`, `validation.py`
- **Dependencies**: Connect to normalization engine (Story 1.3) and storage layer (Story 1.4)

### Performance Standards
- **Memory efficiency**: Stream-based processing, no full file loading
- **Progress reporting**: Update callbacks every 1MB of processed data
- **Error recovery**: Continue parsing when possible, collect all errors
- **Validation speed**: OpenAPI validation must not significantly impact parse time
- **RAM limit**: Never exceed 2GB total memory usage during parsing

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue parsing recoverable sections
- **Detailed reporting**: Line numbers, context, and actionable error messages
- **Error categorization**: Parse errors vs. validation errors vs. warnings
- **Recovery mechanisms**: Skip malformed sections, preserve valid data
- **Logging integration**: Use structured logging for all parsing events

### Testing Standards
- **Unit tests**: `src/tests/unit/test_parser/` with comprehensive coverage
- **Performance tests**: Validate 10MB file processing within limits
- **Error scenario tests**: Test all error handling and recovery paths
- **Integration tests**: Test with real Swagger samples from `data/samples/`
- **Memory tests**: Validate memory usage stays within 2GB limit
- **Progress tests**: Verify progress reporting accuracy and timing

### Sample Data Requirements
- **Small files**: Basic OpenAPI specs for unit testing (< 100KB)
- **Medium files**: Complex APIs for integration testing (1-5MB)
- **Large files**: Enterprise-scale APIs for performance testing (5-10MB)
- **Malformed files**: Invalid JSON and OpenAPI for error testing
- **Edge cases**: Unusual structures, extensions, nested references
