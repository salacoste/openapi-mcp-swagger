# Story 2.1: MCP Protocol Foundation Setup

## Story Overview
**Epic**: Epic 2 - MCP Server Implementation & Protocol Compliance
**Story ID**: 2.1
**Story Type**: Core Infrastructure
**Complexity**: Medium
**Sprint**: TBD

## User Story
As a system,
I want to implement core MCP protocol infrastructure and server framework,
So that AI agents can establish connections and communicate through standardized protocol methods.

## Story Context

### Business Value
- Enables AI agents to connect and query API documentation through standard MCP protocol
- Provides foundation for all MCP server functionality (searchEndpoints, getSchema, getExample)
- Establishes protocol compliance that ensures compatibility with AI coding assistants

### Dependencies
**Depends On:**
- Story 1.4: Basic Storage Layer Implementation (database connection and schema)
- Story 1.5: Core Parsing Pipeline Integration (normalized data available)

**Enables:**
- Story 2.2: searchEndpoints MCP Method Implementation
- Story 2.3: getSchema MCP Method Implementation
- Story 2.4: getExample MCP Method Implementation

### Technical Context
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: SQLite database from Epic 1.4 storage layer
- Technology: Python 3.9+ with Python MCP SDK for protocol compliance
- Follows pattern: Database connection management and configuration from CLI framework
- Touch points: Database connection pool, server configuration, logging framework

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **MCP Server Initialization**
   - Implement MCP server using Python MCP SDK with proper configuration
   - Server initializes successfully with database connection from storage layer
   - Server configuration supports customizable host/port settings via CLI

2. **Protocol Capability Advertisement**
   - Server advertises three core capabilities: `searchEndpoints`, `getSchema`, `getExample`
   - Capability advertisement follows MCP protocol specification exactly
   - AI agents receive correct capability list on connection establishment

3. **Connection Lifecycle Management**
   - Handle MCP connection requests with proper authentication (if configured)
   - Manage active connections with connection pooling and resource cleanup
   - Implement graceful disconnection with proper session termination

### Integration Requirements
4. **Database Layer Integration**
   - Existing SQLite database connection from Epic 1.4 continues to work unchanged
   - MCP server uses existing connection pool without resource conflicts
   - Database transaction isolation maintained for MCP operations

5. **Configuration Pattern Consistency**
   - New MCP server configuration follows existing CLI configuration patterns
   - Server settings integrate with existing config file structure
   - Environment variable overrides work consistently with CLI tool patterns

6. **Logging and Monitoring Integration**
   - MCP server uses existing logging framework with configurable levels
   - Protocol interactions logged with appropriate detail for debugging
   - Server health metrics integrate with existing monitoring approach

### Quality Requirements
7. **Protocol Compliance Testing**
   - All MCP protocol interactions validated against SDK requirements
   - Connection handling tested with multiple concurrent AI agents
   - Protocol message formats verified for JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance

8. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Server startup failures provide clear diagnostic information
   - Connection errors handled gracefully without server crash
   - Database connection failures trigger appropriate fallback behavior

9. **Performance and Resource Management**
   - Server startup time < 5 seconds with typical database size
   - Memory usage remains stable under concurrent connection load
   - No resource leaks in connection establishment/termination cycle

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Architecture Approach
- **Server Framework**: Python MCP SDK for protocol compliance and future-proofing
- **Connection Management**: Async/await patterns for concurrent AI agent connections
- **Database Integration**: Existing SQLite connection pool with read-only queries
- **Configuration**: Extend existing YAML configuration with MCP server section

### Key Implementation Details
```python
# Example server configuration structure
mcp_server:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 8080
  max_connections: 100
  timeout: 30
  capabilities: ["searchEndpoints", "getSchema", "getExample"]
  database_connection: "existing_pool"
```

### Integration Points
- **Database Access**: Use existing data access layer from Epic 1.4
- **Configuration Management**: Extend CLI config with MCP server settings
- **Logging**: Integrate with existing logging configuration and levels
- **Error Handling**: Follow established error reporting patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Connection pooling to handle NFR3 requirement (100+ concurrent AI agents)
- Lazy database connection initialization to reduce startup time
- Connection timeout handling to prevent resource exhaustion
- Memory-efficient message handling for large API documentation

## Definition of Done
- [x] MCP server initializes successfully with database connection
- [x] Server advertises correct capabilities (`searchEndpoints`, `getSchema`, `getExample`)
- [x] Connection lifecycle (connect, authenticate, disconnect) handled properly
- [ ] Multiple concurrent AI agent connections supported (tested with 10+ connections)
- [x] Protocol compliance validated against MCP SDK requirements
- [x] Integration with existing database layer verified (no regression)
- [x] Server configuration follows existing CLI patterns
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for connection management (≥80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests validate full connection workflow
- [ ] Documentation updated with MCP server setup and configuration
- [x] Error scenarios tested and handled gracefully
- [x] Performance requirements met (startup < 5s, stable memory usage)

## Validation Criteria
- Server can be started via CLI and accepts MCP connections
- AI agents can connect and receive capability advertisement
- Database operations from Epic 1 continue to function normally
- Server handles connection errors without crashing
- Protocol compliance validated with MCP SDK test suite

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk** - MCP protocol implementation complexity, concurrent connection handling

**Primary Risks:**
- MCP SDK integration complexity affecting development timeline
- Concurrent connection handling performance under load
- Database connection pool conflicts with existing operations

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Start with proven Python MCP SDK examples and documentation
- Implement connection pooling with conservative limits initially
- Use existing database connection patterns to avoid conflicts
- Comprehensive testing with simulated AI agent connections

**Rollback Plan:**
- Remove MCP server component entirely if integration fails
- Database and parsing functionality remains fully operational
- CLI tool functionality unaffected by MCP server removal

## Story Estimation
**Complexity**: Medium
**Effort**: 3-4 development sessions (12-16 hours)
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Dependencies**: 2 (Epic 1.4, Epic 1.5)
