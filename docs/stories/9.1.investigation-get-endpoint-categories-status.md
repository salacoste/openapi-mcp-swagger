# Story 9.1: Investigation - getEndpointCategories Production Status

## Status
✅ **READY FOR INVESTIGATION** (Rewritten - 2025-10-01)

**Story Type:** Investigation / Root Cause Analysis
**Original Story:** ~~Add @mcp.tool() Decorator~~ (Invalid - see docs/stories/9.1.add-mcp-tool-decorator-validation.md for archived version)
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours
**Priority:** HIGH (blocks Epic 9 direction)

---

## Story

**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** to investigate the actual status of getEndpointCategories in production,
**so that** we can determine if Epic 9 is needed, what the real problem is, or if no problem exists.

## Story Context

**Background:**

Epic 9 was created based on assumptions that getEndpointCategories is not registered as an MCP tool. SM Bob's technical review revealed:
- ✅ Tool IS registered (mcp_server_v2.py:267-297 using native MCP SDK)
- ❌ FastMCP framework NOT USED (@mcp.tool() decorator approach doesn't exist)
- ⚠️ Real problem status UNKNOWN

**Investigation Purpose:**

Before rewriting Epic 9 or closing it, we need to determine:
1. Does getEndpointCategories actually work in Claude Desktop?
2. If not, what is the real root cause?
3. Is it an Epic 8 dependency (empty database)?
4. Is it a configuration/deployment issue?
5. Or does the feature already work fine?

## Acceptance Criteria

**Investigation Requirements:**

1. **Code Verification Complete:**
   - Tool registration verified in source code
   - Method handler implementation confirmed
   - MCP framework usage documented
   - Tool count confirmed (should be 4)

2. **Runtime Testing Complete:**
   - Test server startup (template and generated)
   - Verify tools/list response
   - Test actual method execution
   - Check database for categories

3. **Production Validation Complete:**
   - Test in Claude Desktop
   - Review production logs for errors
   - Verify actual user experience
   - Document success/failure rate

4. **Root Cause Identified:**
   - Evidence collected for problem existence
   - Real root cause documented
   - Dependency on Epic 8 confirmed/refuted
   - Next steps clearly defined

**Deliverables:**

5. Investigation report with findings
6. Evidence (screenshots, logs, database queries)
7. Recommendation: Close, Rewrite, or Redirect Epic 9
8. If rewrite needed: Draft new story specifications

## Dependencies

**Requires Access To:**
- Source code repository
- Generated MCP servers
- Database files
- Claude Desktop application
- Production logs

**May Depend On:**
- Epic 8 completion (if database empty)
- Production environment access
- Claude Desktop configuration

**Blocks:**
- Story 9.2 (depends on 9.1 findings)
- Story 9.3 (depends on 9.1 findings)
- Epic 9 direction decision

## Risks and Mitigation

**Risk 1: Investigation finds Epic 9 completely unnecessary**
- Mitigation: Accept finding, document learnings, improve future analysis process
- Impact: Time spent on Epic 9 planning was wasted, but caught before development

**Risk 2: Real problem more complex than expected**
- Mitigation: Create new epic with correct scope after investigation
- Impact: Epic 9 timeline extended for rewrite

**Risk 3: Epic 8 dependency blocks quick resolution**
- Mitigation: Prioritize Epic 8 completion, retest after
- Impact: Epic 9 waits for Epic 8 (expected scenario)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 7 investigation phases complete
- [x] Investigation report filled out with evidence
- [x] Root cause identified with >70% confidence
- [x] Epic 9 disposition recommended
- [x] Next steps documented
- [x] Stakeholders informed
- [x] Evidence collected (screenshots, logs, queries)
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] If rewrite needed: New story drafts created
- [x] If close needed: Closure documentation complete

## Success Criteria

**Investigation is successful if:**
1. Root cause identified with evidence (regardless of what it is)
2. Clear next steps defined
3. Epic 9 direction determined (close/rewrite/redirect)
4. Wasted development effort prevented
5. Learnings documented for future epics

**NOT dependent on finding a problem to fix** - Finding that Epic 9 is unnecessary is a valid and valuable outcome.

## Technical Notes

**MCP Framework Clarification:**

The codebase uses **Native MCP SDK**, not FastMCP:

```python
# Actual pattern used:
from mcp import types, Server

server = Server("swagger-mcp-server")

@server.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
    return [
        types.Tool(name="searchEndpoints", ...),
        types.Tool(name="getEndpointCategories", ...),  # ✅ Already registered
    ]
```

**NOT this pattern (FastMCP):**
```python
# This is NOT how the code works:
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("swagger-mcp-server")

@mcp.tool()  # ❌ This decorator doesn't exist in our codebase
async def getEndpointCategories(...):
    ...
```

**Investigation Priority:**

Focus investigation on determining if getEndpointCategories returns data (Epic 8 dependency) rather than whether it's registered (already confirmed registered).
