# Story 10.1: Current State Investigation and Documentation

## Status
Done

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Completion Notes
- ✅ searchEndpoints implementation fully analyzed (mcp_server_v2.py:520-700)
- ✅ Repository search methods documented (endpoint_repository.py:88-312)
- ✅ JOIN-based implementation identified (EXISTS subquery with endpoint_categories)
- ✅ Tag transformation logic documented (handles Title-Case and underscores)
- ✅ Database schema inspected (endpoint_categories table populated with 6 categories)
- ✅ Current behavior verified (category filtering FUNCTIONAL and tested)
- ✅ All 6 categories tested (campaign:4, statistics:13, ad:5, search_promo:9, product:5, vendor:4)
- ✅ AND logic verified (correct implementation with EXISTS)
- ✅ Epic 8 integration confirmed (JOIN approach working as designed)
- ✅ Comprehensive investigation report created and updated

### Investigation Summary
| Aspect | Status | Finding |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Code Quality | ✅ EXCELLENT | 10/10 - JOIN-based implementation |
| Database Schema | ✅ EXCELLENT | `endpoint_categories` table populated |
| Filtering Logic | ✅ CORRECT | AND logic with EXISTS subquery |
| Data Population | ✅ WORKING | 6 categories, 40 endpoints matched |

## Story

**As a** QA engineer,
**I want** complete understanding of current searchEndpoints category filtering behavior,
**so that** we can validate improvements after Issues #002 and #003 are resolved.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: `swagger_mcp_server/server/mcp_server_v2.py`, `swagger_mcp_server/storage/repository.py`
- Technology: Python 3.11+, SQLite, FTS5 search
- Follows pattern: Code review, SQL query analysis, behavior documentation
- Touch points:
  - searchEndpoints implementation
  - EndpointRepository query methods
  - Database schema and indexes
  - Production logs analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. searchEndpoints implementation fully documented:
   - SQL queries identified and documented
   - Filtering logic explained (AND vs OR)
   - Data source identified (table vs tags)
   - Fallback behavior documented

2. Current behavior baseline established:
   - Test query + category combinations
   - Document actual results vs expected
   - Identify cross-category contamination
   - Measure performance metrics

3. Database schema analysis complete:
   - Verify endpoints-categories relationship
   - Check indexes and constraints
   - Validate foreign keys
   - Document schema structure

4. Root cause analysis documented:
   - Why mixed results occur
   - What data source is used
   - How filters are combined
   - What needs to change after Issue #002

**Quality Requirements:**

5. Documentation comprehensive and clear
6. Baseline results reproducible
7. SQL queries tested and verified
8. Performance metrics recorded

## Implementation Details

### Investigation Checklist

```markdown
## searchEndpoints Investigation Report

### Current Implementation

**File:** src/swagger_mcp_server/server/mcp_server_v2.py

**Method Signature:**
```python
async def searchEndpoints(
    query: str,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 10
)
```

**SQL Query:** [Document actual query found]

**Filtering Logic:** [Document AND vs OR logic]

**Data Source:** [endpoint_categories table | tags | path matching]

### Test Results

| Query | Category | Expected | Actual | Issue |
|-------|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| "campaign" | "statistics" | Only statistics | Mixed | Cross-category |
| "list" | "campaign" | Only campaign | Mixed | Cross-category |
| "" | "statistics" | All statistics | ? | To test |

### Root Cause

[Document why mixed results occur]

### Recommendations

[Document what needs to change]
```

## Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- None - pure investigation

**Blocks:**
- Story 10.2 - Test development needs baseline

## Definition of Done

- [x] searchEndpoints code fully reviewed
- [x] Current behavior documented
- [x] Database schema analyzed
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Baseline established
- [x] Performance metrics recorded
- [x] Investigation report complete
- [x] Ready for Story 10.2
