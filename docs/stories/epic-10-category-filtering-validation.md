# Epic 10: Category Filtering Validation and Quality Assurance - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Validate and verify that searchEndpoints category filtering works correctly after Issues #002 and #003 are resolved, ensuring accurate category-based search with proper AND/OR logic, comprehensive test coverage, and production readiness for Epic 6.3.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: searchEndpoints method with category parameter (implemented in Epic 6.3)
- Technology stack: Python 3.11+, SQLite database with FTS5, FastMCP framework, SQLAlchemy ORM
- Integration points: searchEndpoints MCP method, EndpointRepository query logic, endpoint_categories table, database indexes
- Current limitation: Category filtering behavior unclear due to empty endpoint_categories table (Issue #002)

**Problem Analysis:**

**Problem: Category Filtering Behavior Requires Validation**

The searchEndpoints method accepts a `category` parameter, but its behavior needs thorough validation because:

1. **Empty Categories Table (Issue #002):** endpoint_categories table has 0 records
2. **Filtering Still Works:** Category filtering appears functional in production logs
3. **Unclear Data Source:** Unknown if using database table, OpenAPI tags fallback, or keyword matching
4. **Mixed Results:** Production logs show endpoints from multiple categories when filtering by one

**Evidence from Production Logs (2025-09-30 21:23:01 UTC):**

**Test Case 1: query="campaign" + category="statistics"**
```
Response: 5 endpoints
1. GET /api/client/campaign               ❌ "campaign" category, not "statistics"
2. GET /api/client/campaign/{id}/objects  ❌ "campaign" category
3. POST /api/client/min/sku               ❌ Different category
4. POST /api/client/statistics/video      ✅ "statistics" category
5. GET /api/client/statistics/report      ✅ "statistics" category
```

**Observation:** Results include BOTH campaign and statistics endpoints. Expected: ONLY statistics endpoints.

**Test Case 2: query="list" + category="campaigns"**
```
Response: 5 endpoints
1. GET /api/client/campaign                    ✅ "campaign" category
2. GET /api/client/campaign/{id}/objects       ✅ "campaign" category
3. GET /api/client/limits/list                 ❌ Different category
4. GET /api/client/statistics/list             ❌ "statistics" not "campaign"
5. GET /api/client/statistics/externallist     ❌ "statistics" not "campaign"
```

**Observation:** Again mixing categories. Expected: ONLY campaign category endpoints.

**Test Case 3: query="test" + category="nonexistent"**
```
Response: 0 endpoints
```

**Observation:** ✅ Correctly returns empty for invalid category.

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**

**Hypothesis 1: Keyword-Based Filtering (Most Likely)**
```python
# Current suspected implementation
SELECT * FROM endpoints
WHERE (path LIKE '%query%' OR description LIKE '%query%')
  AND (path LIKE '%category%' OR tags LIKE '%category%')
# ❌ This would match "statistics" in path even when filtering by different category
```

**Hypothesis 2: Tag-Based Fallback**
```python
# Possible fallback when endpoint_categories table is empty
SELECT * FROM endpoints
WHERE tags LIKE '%category_name%'
  AND (path LIKE '%query%' OR description LIKE '%query%')
# ⚠️ Could work but lacks category metadata accuracy
```

**Hypothesis 3: Fuzzy Matching with OR Logic**
```python
# Bug: Using OR instead of AND between filters
SELECT * FROM endpoints
WHERE query_matches OR category_matches
# ❌ Returns results if EITHER query OR category matches, not both
```

**Investigation Questions:**

1. **What is the current filtering logic?**
   - Database table join (ideal but table is empty)
   - OpenAPI tags fallback (likely current)
   - Keyword matching in paths (explains mixed results)

2. **Why mixed results?**
   - Keyword "campaign" matches both campaign endpoints AND statistics endpoints with "campaign" in description
   - Fuzzy matching or incorrect AND/OR logic
   - Multiple tags causing cross-category matches

3. **What happens after Issue #002 is fixed?**
   - Will logic automatically switch to database-based filtering?
   - Will it require code changes?
   - Will existing behavior change?

**Enhancement Details:**

**What's being validated:**

1. **Current State Documentation**
   - Investigate searchEndpoints implementation in mcp_server_v2.py
   - Document current filtering logic and data source
   - Identify SQL queries or search algorithms
   - Understand AND vs OR logic for combined filters

2. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Ensure Issue #002 resolved (endpoint_categories populated)
   - Ensure Issue #003 resolved (getEndpointCategories registered)
   - Verify database relationships (endpoints → endpoint_categories)

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test exact category matching (category="statistics" → only statistics)
   - Test category + query combination (both filters apply with AND)
   - Test invalid category handling (graceful empty results)
   - Test null category behavior (returns all results)
   - Test empty query with category (category filter alone)
   - Test performance with large APIs (1000+ endpoints)

4. **Before/After Comparison**
   - Document behavior with empty categories table (current)
   - Document behavior after table population (target)
   - Identify regressions or breaking changes
   - Validate improvements in accuracy

**How it integrates:**

- Validates existing searchEndpoints implementation
- No new features added (pure validation/testing epic)
- May identify bugs requiring fixes in separate stories
- Updates test coverage and QA gates for Epic 6.3
- Provides confidence for production deployment

**Success criteria:**

- Current filtering logic fully documented and understood
- Comprehensive test suite covering all scenarios
- Category filtering uses database table efficiently (after Issue #002)
- Exact category matching (no cross-category contamination)
- Query + category combination uses AND logic correctly
- Invalid categories handled gracefully (empty results)
- Performance < 100ms for category-filtered searches
- All tests pass with populated endpoint_categories table
- QA gates updated with actual behavior documentation
- Epic 6.3 marked as "Production Ready" with confidence

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Current State Investigation and Documentation**
   - Review searchEndpoints implementation in mcp_server_v2.py
   - Document current filtering logic (SQL queries, search algorithms)
   - Identify data source (database table vs OpenAPI tags fallback)
   - Understand AND vs OR logic for combined filters
   - Create baseline behavior documentation for comparison

2. **Story 2: Comprehensive Test Suite Development**
   - Create test cases for exact category matching
   - Create test cases for category + query combination
   - Create test cases for edge cases (invalid, null, empty)
   - Create performance benchmarks for large APIs
   - Implement before/after comparison tests
   - Add test coverage for all filtering scenarios

3. **Story 3: Post-Fix Validation and Production Readiness**
   - Wait for Issue #002 resolution (categories table populated)
   - Wait for Issue #003 resolution (getEndpointCategories registered)
   - Run full test suite against updated system
   - Document behavior changes and improvements
   - Verify no regressions in existing functionality
   - Update QA gates and mark Epic 6.3 production-ready

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing searchEndpoints behavior without category parameter remains unchanged
- [x] No breaking changes to method signature or API contract
- [x] Backward compatibility with existing MCP clients
- [x] Performance impact < 10% for category-filtered searches

## Technical Analysis Appendix

### Expected Filtering Logic (Target State)

**Ideal Implementation with Database Table:**

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def searchEndpoints(
    query: str,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    category: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 10
):
    """Search API endpoints with optional category filtering."""
    db = get_database_manager()

    # Base query with FTS5 full-text search
    base_query = db.endpoints.filter(
        or_(
            db.endpoints.path.like(f"%{query}%"),
            db.endpoints.summary.like(f"%{query}%"),
            db.endpoints.description.like(f"%{query}%")
        )
    )

    # ✅ AND logic: Apply category filter if specified
    if category:
        base_query = base_query.join(db.endpoint_categories).filter(
            db.endpoint_categories.category_name == category
        )

    # ✅ AND logic: Apply method filter if specified
    if method:
        base_query = base_query.filter(
            db.endpoints.method == method.upper()
        )

    # Limit and execute
    results = base_query.limit(limit).all()
    return format_results(results)
```

**Key Points:**
- Uses JOIN to endpoint_categories table for accurate filtering
- AND logic between all filters (query AND category AND method)
- Returns ONLY endpoints matching ALL specified criteria

### Current State Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1: Keyword Matching (Suspected Current)**

```python
# ❌ Problem: Matches category keyword in path/description
SELECT * FROM endpoints
WHERE (path LIKE '%query%' OR description LIKE '%query%')
  AND (path LIKE '%category%' OR description LIKE '%category%')
```

**Why this explains mixed results:**
- query="campaign" + category="statistics" matches:
  - Campaign endpoints (path contains "campaign")
  - Statistics endpoints (path contains "statistics")
  - ✅ Results include both categories

**Hypothesis 2: Tag-Based Fallback**

```python
# ⚠️ Better but lacks accuracy
SELECT * FROM endpoints
WHERE tags LIKE '%category%'
  AND (path LIKE '%query%' OR description LIKE '%query%')
```

**Why this might work but has issues:**
- Uses OpenAPI tags directly from Swagger spec
- No category metadata (counts, display names, descriptions)
- Inefficient without proper indexing

### Test Coverage Matrix

| Test Case | Query | Category | Method | Expected Behavior | Current Status | Post-Fix Status |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Exact category match | "" | "statistics" | null | Only statistics endpoints | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Expected |
| Category + query | "campaign" | "statistics" | null | Statistics endpoints with "campaign" | ❌ Mixed results | ✅ Expected |
| Category + method | "" | "campaign" | "GET" | Campaign GET endpoints only | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Expected |
| Invalid category | "test" | "invalid" | null | Empty results | ✅ Works | ✅ Maintained |
| Null category | "campaign" | null | null | All endpoints matching "campaign" | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Expected |
| Empty query + category | "" | "campaign" | null | All campaign endpoints | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Expected |
| All filters combined | "list" | "statistics" | "POST" | Statistics POST endpoints with "list" | ❓ Unknown | ✅ Expected |

### Performance Benchmarks

**Target Performance (After Issue #002 Fix):**

| API Size | Endpoints | Categories | Search Time (no category) | Search Time (with category) | Improvement |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Small | 10-50 | 3-5 | < 50ms | < 30ms | 40% faster |
| Medium | 50-200 | 5-10 | < 100ms | < 50ms | 50% faster |
| Large | 200-1000 | 10-20 | < 200ms | < 80ms | 60% faster |
| Enterprise | 1000+ | 20+ | < 500ms | < 100ms | 80% faster |

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Database index on endpoint_categories.category_name
- Database index on endpoints.category_id (foreign key)
- FTS5 full-text search index on endpoint content
- Query result caching for frequently accessed categories

### Expected vs Actual Behavior Documentation

**Scenario 1: query="campaign" + category="statistics"**

**Current (Suspected):**
```
Results: 5 endpoints
✅ POST /api/client/statistics/video       # Matches: path contains "statistics"
✅ GET /api/client/statistics/report       # Matches: path contains "statistics"
❌ GET /api/client/campaign                # Matches: path contains "campaign" (wrong!)
❌ GET /api/client/campaign/{id}/objects   # Matches: path contains "campaign" (wrong!)
❌ POST /api/client/min/sku                # Matches: description? (wrong!)
```

**Expected (After Fix):**
```
Results: 0-2 endpoints
✅ POST /api/client/statistics/campaign    # IF exists: statistics category + "campaign" in path
✅ GET /api/client/statistics/campaign     # IF exists: statistics category + "campaign" in path
❌ All campaign category endpoints excluded (different category)
```

**Scenario 2: query="" + category="statistics"**

**Expected:**
```
Results: All statistics endpoints (13 for Ozon API)
✅ POST /api/client/statistics
✅ POST /api/client/statistics/video
✅ GET /api/client/statistics/{UUID}
✅ POST /api/client/statistics/json
✅ GET /api/client/statistics/report
... (all 13 statistics endpoints)
❌ Zero campaign, ad, product, search_promo, or vendor endpoints
```

## Story Manager Handoff

"Please develop detailed user stories for this validation and quality assurance epic. Key considerations:

- This is a validation task to ensure searchEndpoints category filtering works correctly
- Integration points: searchEndpoints MCP method, EndpointRepository query logic, endpoint_categories table, database indexes
- Existing patterns to follow: Comprehensive testing, before/after comparison, performance benchmarking
- Critical dependencies: Issue #002 (categories table population) and Issue #003 (getEndpointCategories registration) MUST be resolved first
- Each story must document findings and may create new bug fix stories if issues discovered
- Testing target: 100% test coverage for category filtering scenarios, < 100ms performance, zero cross-category contamination

The epic should provide complete confidence in category filtering accuracy while maintaining system integrity and identifying any bugs requiring separate fixes."
