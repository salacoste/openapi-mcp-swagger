key_strengths:
  - "Thorough code analysis identified JOIN-based implementation (not tag-based as initially assumed)"
  - "Comprehensive database schema analysis confirmed Epic 8 integration"
  - "All 6 Ozon categories tested and verified (campaign:4, statistics:13, ad:5, search_promo:9, product:5, vendor:4)"
  - "AND logic correctly identified and documented (EXISTS subquery)"
  - "Tag transformation logic fully documented (handles Title-Case conversion)"
  - "Established solid baseline for Story 10.2 test development"
  - "Investigation report provides clear technical documentation"

  notes: "Epic 8 successfully integrated, categories available for filtering"

tag_transformation:
  logic: "category_name → Tag format (e.g., 'campaign' → 'Campaign', 'search_promo' → 'Search-Promo')"
  implementation: "repository layer handles transformation"
  correctness: "VERIFIED"

baseline_established:
  code_implementation: "JOIN-based with EXISTS subquery"

    - action: "Proceed to Story 10.2 test development"
      refs: ["Story 10.2"]
      priority: high
