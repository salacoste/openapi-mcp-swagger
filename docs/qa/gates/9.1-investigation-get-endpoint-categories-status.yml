recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Execute investigation immediately"
      refs: ["Story 9.1 investigation tasks"]
      priority: high
      rationale: "Blocks all Epic 9 direction decisions, prevents wasted development effort"

  future:
    - action: "Based on investigation findings, update Epic 9 direction"
      refs: ["Epic 9"]
      priority: high
      rationale: "Close, rewrite, or redirect Epic 9 based on evidence"

    - action: "Document MCP architecture patterns in project documentation"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/mcp-architecture.md"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Prevent future confusion about FastMCP vs Native MCP SDK"

epic_9_disposition_pending_investigation:
  current_status: "BLOCKED - Awaiting investigation results"
  possible_outcomes:
    - "Close Epic 9 - No problem exists (5% probability)"
    - "Redirect to Epic 8 - Database dependency (80% probability)"
    - "Rewrite Epic 9 - Real problem needs different fix (10% probability)"
    - "Create New Epic - Different problem identified (5% probability)"

success_criteria:
  investigation_value: "Finding that Epic 9 is unnecessary is a valid and valuable outcome"
  decision_clarity: "Root cause identified with >70% confidence"
  waste_prevention: "Wasted development effort prevented by investigation"
  learnings_documented: "Process improvements captured for future epics"
