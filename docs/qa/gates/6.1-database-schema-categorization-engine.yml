# Risk assessment summary
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 1  # Test coverage gap
    high: 2      # Pipeline integration, repository method
    medium: 2    # Error handling, thread safety
    low: 0
  highest: 9     # Test coverage risk scored as 9/10
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Implement complete test suite (12-16 hours estimated)"
      - "Integrate into conversion pipeline (4 hours estimated)"
      - "Add missing repository method (2 hours estimated)"
    monitor:
      - "Add error handling for edge cases"
      - "Fix thread safety in CategoryCatalog"
      - "Validate performance claims with benchmarks"

# Audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-09-30T00:00:00Z"
    gate: FAIL
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Initial comprehensive review. Excellent code quality on implemented portions, but story is incomplete (60% actual vs 95% claimed). Critical blockers: zero tests, pipeline integration missing, repository method incomplete. Total work remaining: 21-25 hours."
    actions_taken:
      - "Fixed type hint compatibility issue (endpoint_processor.py)"
      - "Fixed SQLAlchemy JSON serialization bug (endpoint_processor.py)"
      - "Removed unused import (endpoint_processor.py)"

# Additional context
review_notes: |
  This story demonstrates excellent software engineering practices in the implemented components:
  - Clean separation of concerns (categorization.py, endpoint_processor.py)
  - Proper use of design patterns (dataclasses, LRU caching, strategy pattern)
  - Comprehensive migration with rollback support
  - Good database schema design with proper indexes

  However, the story cannot be considered "Ready for Review" or "95% Complete" due to:
  1. ZERO test coverage (0/4 required test files exist)
  2. Pipeline integration incomplete (EndpointProcessor not wired)
  3. Repository method missing (get_endpoints_by_category())

  The implemented code is production-quality, but without tests and complete integration,
  the feature cannot be validated, deployed, or maintained with confidence.

  Estimated actual completion: 60%
  - Schema/Migration: 100%
  - Categorization engine: 100%
  - Pipeline integration: 0%
  - Repository methods: 50%
  - Testing: 0%

  Recommendation: Address all P0 blockers before requesting QA re-review.
  Story owner should update status from "Ready for Review" to "In Progress".
