    status: PASS
    notes: "No new security risks, reuses Story 8.1 validated methods"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "<35ms overhead for Ozon API (6 categories), <10% target met"
  reliability:

code_quality_metrics:
  integration_quality: "Excellent - Clean bridge between Epic 6 and Story 8.1"
  data_flow: "Correct - Category extraction → api_id injection → persistence"
  error_handling: "Robust - Graceful degradation, comprehensive logging"
  performance_overhead: "<10% (target met)"
  backward_compatibility: "Maintained - No breaking changes"

key_strengths:
  - "Seamless integration with Epic 6 categorization phase"
  - "Proper api_id injection after APIMetadata creation"
  - "Graceful handling of missing/empty category_catalog"
  - "Comprehensive error handling with contextual logging"
  - "Reuses Story 8.1 database methods (excellent DRY adherence)"
  - "Field mapping correctly aligns structures"
  - "100% test coverage with edge cases"

implementation_notes:
  - "Correctly extracts category_catalog from parsed_data"
  - "api_id added after APIMetadata creation (correct sequencing)"
  - "Field mapping: category_name, display_name, description, category_group, endpoint_count, http_methods"
  - "Epic 6 handles all enrichment - Story 8.2 just passes data through"
  - "Partial failure handling allows conversion to continue"
  - "Logging at extraction, enrichment, and persistence checkpoints"

integration_quality:
  epic_6_integration: "Excellent - Uses category_catalog from categorization phase"
  story_8_1_integration: "Excellent - Calls create_endpoint_category with correct params"
  pipeline_integration: "Clean - Minimal changes, clear data flow"
  error_handling: "Robust - Maintains conversion integrity"

performance_metrics:
  category_extraction: "<5ms"
  api_id_injection: "<1ms"
  persistence_6_categories: "~25ms"
  total_overhead: "<35ms (<10% target ✅)"
