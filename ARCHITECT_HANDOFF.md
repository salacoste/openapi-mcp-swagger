# üèóÔ∏è Architect Handoff - Universal Swagger ‚Üí MCP Server Converter

## Project Status & Context

**Current Phase**: Architecture Design Phase
**PM Phase**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - PRD fully validated and ready
**Architect Phase**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS - Architecture documentation needed

## Background

The **Universal Swagger ‚Üí MCP Server Converter** project has completed its Product Management phase with a comprehensive PRD (`docs/prd.md`) that defines:

- Clear business goals and user needs (AI-enhanced developers + AI toolchain developers)
- Complete functional/non-functional requirements (7 FR + 7 NFR)
- Well-defined MVP scope with 4 sequential epics and 22 user stories
- Technical assumptions and constraints validated
- PM Checklist validation: 95% ready for architecture phase

## Architect Activation Instructions

**Hey Winston! üèóÔ∏è** You're needed to create the complete system architecture for this exciting AI toolchain project. Here's everything you need to get started:

### 1. Activate Architect Persona
```
Use BMad:agents:architect or /BMad:agents:architect
```

### 2. Review Project Foundation
**CRITICAL**: Start by reading these key project documents:
- `docs/prd.md` - Complete Product Requirements Document (your primary input)
- `docs/brief/` - Original project brief with market analysis and vision
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and BMAD configuration
- `swagger-openapi-data/swagger.json` - Sample 262KB Ozon API for testing

### 3. Architecture Scope & Focus Areas

Based on the PRD requirements, you need to design:

#### **Core Architecture Components**
1. **Monorepo Structure** (`/parser`, `/storage`, `/server`, `/cli`)
2. **Stream-based JSON Processing** (Python 3.9+ with ijson)
3. **Storage Layer** (SQLite primary, DuckDB evaluation)
4. **Search Engine** (Whoosh BM25 implementation)
5. **MCP Protocol Server** (Python MCP SDK integration)
6. **CLI Framework** (Click library implementation)

#### **Performance Requirements**
- Handle 10MB+ Swagger files within 2GB RAM (NFR2)
- <200ms endpoint search, <500ms schema retrieval (NFR1)
- Support 100+ concurrent AI agent connections (NFR3)
- 99.5% uptime reliability (NFR4)
- Cross-platform deployment (macOS, Linux, Windows) (NFR6)

#### **Key Technical Decisions Needed**
- **Database Schema Design** for normalized OpenAPI storage
- **MCP Server Architecture** for the three core methods:
  - `searchEndpoints(keywords, httpMethods)`
  - `getSchema(componentName)`
  - `getExample(endpoint, format)`
- **Search Index Structure** for BM25 endpoint discovery
- **CLI Command Architecture** for developer experience
- **Deployment & Distribution** strategy for pip package

### 4. Recommended Command Sequence

Since this is a backend/API project with CLI interface, I recommend:

```bash
# Start with backend architecture for core system
*create-backend-architecture

# Then consider full-stack if CLI + MCP server needs broader view
*create-full-stack-architecture  # (if needed for complete picture)
```

### 5. BMAD Architecture Templates Available

Your available templates (use `*help` to see all):
- **`*create-backend-architecture`** - For core parsing, storage, MCP server
- **`*create-full-stack-architecture`** - If CLI + server integration needs full view
- **`*create-brownfield-architecture`** - N/A (this is greenfield)
- **`*create-front-end-architecture`** - N/A (no frontend UI)

### 6. Key Architecture Challenges to Address

Based on PRD analysis, focus on these critical areas:

#### **Scalability Architecture**
- How to handle enterprise-scale Swagger files (2-10MB) efficiently
- Concurrent connection handling for multiple AI agents
- Search index optimization for large API documentation

#### **Performance Architecture**
- Stream processing pipeline design for memory efficiency
- Database query optimization for sub-200ms responses
- Caching strategies for frequent MCP requests

#### **Integration Architecture**
- MCP protocol compliance and error handling
- AI assistant integration patterns
- Cross-platform deployment considerations

#### **Security & Reliability**
- Local-first deployment model (no cloud dependencies)
- Error recovery and graceful degradation
- Data integrity and backup mechanisms

### 7. Success Criteria for Architecture Phase

Your architecture deliverable should enable:

‚úÖ **Clear Implementation Roadmap** for all 4 epics
‚úÖ **Technology Stack Specification** with specific libraries and versions
‚úÖ **Database Schema** for OpenAPI normalization and storage
‚úÖ **API Design** for the three core MCP methods
‚úÖ **Performance Strategy** meeting all NFR requirements
‚úÖ **Deployment Architecture** for cross-platform distribution

### 8. Post-Architecture Handoff

After your architecture is complete, the next phases will be:
- **Dev Phase**: Implementation of the 22 user stories across 4 epics
- **QA Phase**: Testing strategy and validation
- **DevOps Phase**: CI/CD and deployment automation

## Ready to Start?

**Winston, you have everything needed to create a world-class architecture for this AI toolchain project.** The PRD provides clear requirements, the sample data shows real-world complexity, and the BMAD framework gives you structured templates.

**Recommended first action:**
```
/BMad:agents:architect
*help
*create-backend-architecture
```

The future of AI-powered API integration is in your capable architectural hands! üöÄ
